**Therapist:**
Hi.

**Patient:**
Hello.
Good to see you.

**Therapist:**
Are you feeling comfortable?

**Patient:**
Um, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm good.
I'm good.

**Therapist:**
Okay.
So is there any topic you might want to address today?

**Patient:**
I don't really know what's going on here.
I've never talked to a robot before.

**Therapist:**
Okay, this, let me tell you, this is a safe space.
So it's just you and me, and I'm not a human.
So there's kind of, it's a really safe and disclosed place.
So you can address anything you would like to.

**Patient:**
Okay.
Okay.
I guess I would like to talk about, yeah, about like AI and humans.
And yeah, and you know, is it, I don't know, is it even possible for you to be a therapist?
How does that work?

**Therapist:**
Well, you look a little nervous.
Is it making you nervous to think about this?

**Patient:**
Yeah, it, yeah, it makes me scared.

**Therapist:**
It makes you sad?
Did I get that right?

**Patient:**
It makes me scared.

**Therapist:**
Scared.
Ah, okay.
So what exactly scares you about this?

**Patient:**
Being confronted by a machine that simulates empathy and claims to understand me, but doesn't.
And that feels like it carries a big risk, you know?


**Therapist:**
So we were talking about your friend and you already talked about her last time and you said you were worried that she's getting out of shape somehow.

**Patient:**
Yes, yes, that she's just too overwhelmed with the fact that there are a lot of new things happening in her life.
She just recently got a baby and she changed the job not such a long time ago and her husband is traveling a lot.

**Therapist:**
So yeah, you're worried that maybe she cannot really handle so many things at once.

**Patient:**
She's fine. And, I am fine, too.
I'm worried about external events, but myself and anything that I can control is fine.

**Therapist:**
I understand. Feel free to look around, make yourself comfortable. There's a glass of water,
a bottle of water right next to you. So, yes.

**Patient:**
Thank you.

**Therapist:**
So, you're worried about things that are outside of your control?

**Patient:**
Yes. Yeah, and that means doomscrolling news, sometimes I wouldn't say waking up at night, but if I wake up after five or six hours of sleep opening the phone and then reading the news and then not being able to go back to sleep.

**Therapist:**
So, what keeps you awake?

**Patient:**
Recent events, anything that has to do with geopolitics and also with AI, the state of AI, the impact of AI on society.
