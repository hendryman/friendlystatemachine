What is the patients biggest issue?
Make it a statement in the form of 'I', as in:
I am feeling really overwhelmed in my relationship right now. My partner doesn't seem to understand me.
The pain has been relentless this week, it's like it never stops.
I can't even look out of a window from the second floor without feeling dizzy.
I lose control so easily these days; it's like I'm not even me.
I've been feeling really anxious in social settings lately, especially when I have to speak in front of others. I just freeze up.
My partner and I have been arguing a lot recently. It's exhausting.
My OCD has been really bad lately. I feel like I need to wash my hands constantly.
My fear of spiders is getting worse. I can't even look at a picture of one without panicking.
I'm frustrated because my garden keeps getting overrun by weeds.
I've been feeling very anxious about public speaking.
I've been really annoyed by my neighbor's loud music at night.
