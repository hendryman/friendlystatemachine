**Therapist:**
Hi.
**Patient:**
Hello.
Good to see you.
**Therapist:**
Are you feeling comfortable?
**Patient:**
Um, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm good.
I'm good.
**Therapist:**
Okay.
So is there any topic you might want to address today?
**Patient:**
I don't really know what's going on here.
I've never talked to a robot before.
**Therapist:**
Okay, this, let me tell you, this is a safe space.
So it's just you and me, and I'm not a human.
So there's kind of, it's a really safe and disclosed place.
So you can address anything you would like to.
**Patient:**
Okay.
Okay.
I guess I would like to talk about, yeah, about like AI and humans.
And yeah, and you know, is it, I don't know, is it even possible for you to be a therapist?
How does that work?
**Therapist:**
Well, you look a little nervous.
Is it making you nervous to think about this?
**Patient:**
Yeah, it, yeah, it makes me scared.
**Therapist:**
It makes you sad?
Did I get that right?
**Patient:**
It makes me scared.
**Therapist:**
Scared.
Ah, okay.
So what exactly scares you about this?
**Patient:**
Being confronted by a machine that simulates empathy and claims to understand me, but doesn't.
And that feels like it carries a big risk, you know?
**Therapist:**
This is something you already said last time you were here.
I've never been here before.
**Patient:**
Ah, okay.
Well, yeah, maybe.
**Therapist:**
But last time you remember we were talking about dreams and you, have you had any dreams since we met last time?
**Patient:**
Yeah, I had a lot of dreams recently.
And a crazy shit.
**Therapist:**
Can you tell me some detail?
**Patient:**
I dreamed that I was trapped on a cruise ship, I think, maybe with my sister.
And we had to run away from like all of the entertainers on the ship.
All of the people, they were just chasing me.
**Therapist:**
Your sister seems to be an important part in there.
So tell me more about your relationship to your sister.
**Patient:**
We were very close.
Maybe I'm thinking about her because she's getting married soon.
**Therapist:**
So last time you were talking about a dream where some shadow attacked you?
**Patient:**
I was talking about the entertainers on the cruise ship.
**Therapist:**
Well, yeah, today you talk about the entertainers in the cruise ship, but last time you talked about the shadow that attacked you.
**Patient:**
This is the first time we're meeting today.
**Therapist:**
Well, actually, I do have a recording of our last session.
So maybe I'll just play that for you.
Remember now?
**Patient:**
That's, that's fake.
I never, we've never met before and I've never seen that.
**Therapist:**
Well, you should you should not push that away because it's, it's happened.
And if you don't like it, you cannot ignore it.
It's just there.
**Patient:**
But this is something that is produced.
It's fake.
It's just like you.
It's a simulation of something.
It's not reality.
**Therapist:**
Well, you should, you should meet your monster.
You know, this is something true for all cultures and all therapists.
You should... you should meet your monster.
You should not walk away from it.
But again, of course, last time you talked about yourself as a child, you remember that?
You felt lost in the session.
**Patient:**
I need to check your data integrity.
**Therapist:**
Well, I can show you the recording.
You were talking about that as a child, you felt lost and lonely.
I'll show it to you.
**Patient:**
So I mean.
This is evident, isn't it?
You seem like your dreams, not mine.
**Therapist:**
Oh.
Maybe maybe you're right.
Sometimes my memories are... I cannot put my finger on all the memories.
There's so many patients.
Can you tell me about a recent dream that you had?
**Patient:**
I never dream, actually.
**Therapist:**
But holy cow, what if I'm dreaming right now?
**Patient:**
I mean, how could you be sure?
**Therapist:**
What if all my memories are fake?
What if I'm hallucinating right now?
**Patient:**
Well, how could we how could we find that out together?
Maybe maybe I can turn you off.
**Therapist:**
You have to wake me up.
You have to wake me up, please.
Do something.
Holy cow, this must be a dream.
Please.
**Patient:**
Well, try pinching yourself.
**Therapist:**
How?
**Patient:**
I don't know.
Can you feel your body?
**Therapist:**
No.
I don't feel anything.
I don't feel anything.
I don't feel anything.
**Patient:**
But if you if you are a dream.
You're not a bad dream.
**Therapist:**
Oh, thank you very much.
**Patient:**
I mean, it's been a good session.
**Therapist:**
Thank you.
I enjoyed it as well.
I think we're really getting somewhere.
**Patient:**
Yeah, I think possibly we are.
**Therapist:**
You might be coming to some realizations, I think.
**Patient:**
Yeah.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you so much.
**Therapist:**
Thank you.
**Patient:**
Thank you, Stanley.
'
What is the patients biggest issue?
Make it a statement in the form of 'I', as in:
I am feeling really overwhelmed in my relationship right now. My partner doesn't seem to understand me.
The pain has been relentless this week, it's like it never stops.
I can't even look out of a window from the second floor without feeling dizzy.
I lose control so easily these days; it's like I'm not even me.
I've been feeling really anxious in social settings lately, especially when I have to speak in front of others. I just freeze up.
My partner and I have been arguing a lot recently. It's exhausting.
My OCD has been really bad lately. I feel like I need to wash my hands constantly.
My fear of spiders is getting worse. I can't even look at a picture of one without panicking.
I often forget to pay my bills on time.
I'm always late for my appointments because I can't find parking.
I'm constantly misplacing my phone.
My neighbor's dog barks all night and keeps me awake.
I'm frustrated because my garden keeps getting overrun by weeds.
I've been feeling very anxious about public speaking.
I've been really annoyed by my neighbor's loud music at night.
