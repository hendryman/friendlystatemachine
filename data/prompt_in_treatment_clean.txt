**Patient:**
I told you.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Told me what?

**Patient:**
That you'd be sorry you ever encouraged me to cry here.

**Dr. Stanley:**
I'm not sorry at all.

**Patient:**
Didn't expect it to be like this, I bet.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Like what?

**Patient:**
You know what? It's disappointing.
I thought I'd feel better, relieved.
Thought it'd be a lot more fun.

**Dr. Stanley:**
And it isn't?

**Patient:**
No, it's horrible.
I don't know if I'm gonna be able to talk today, Dr. Stanley.
I shouldn't have come, I should have just...
I should have just called it off. I'm sorry.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Are you all right?

**Patient:**
Yeah.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Sit down. Sit.

**Patient:**
I've been sitting out in the park for about four hours.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Here?

**Patient:**
Yeah.
I wanted to call it off, the session, but...
I wasn't sure I'd be able to make it home alone.
I took a cab here. My car's at home.
God, at least I think it is.
Yeah, yeah, my car's at home.
God, it's freezing. I came this close to knocking on your door and asking for a sweater.

**Dr. Stanley:**
When was that?

**Patient:**
I don't know, maybe five or six.
I can't remember. It was still dark.
Waited for the sun to come up.
I never waited this long for a sunrise, except maybe on a camping trip in fifth grade.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Thank you.

**Patient:**
You know what I did?

**Dr. Stanley:**
What?

**Patient:**
I held my cellphone and I watched the minutes go by.
It felt like forever for one minute to turn into the next.
I thought to myself, "How stupid is this?
"Dying on a street like roadkill outside your therapist's office." I'm sorry, Dr. Stanley, I...
I should have called it off. I shouldn't have come.

**Dr. Stanley:**
You should have come here.
What happened last night?

**Patient:**
Well, what didn't happen?
Want the long version or the bottom line?
Because the bottom line's very simple.
My life is over.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Then you'd better tell me the long version.

**Patient:**
I left Andrew. We had a big blowout screaming, crying, the works.
Then at some point, I called Ilona, and we went out for a drink, and...
we had a few drinks.
Listen, I'm not here. I'm so totally not here.

**Dr. Stanley:**
You are very much here.

**Patient:**
No, it's not me that's here.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Believe me, you'd be shocked to know the person that's sitting here.

**Patient:**
Did some...
I did some terrible things last night.
 I feel sick.
I don't wanna throw up.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Doesn't matter, it's no big deal.

**Patient:**
What do you mean?
It's vomit. I'm not gonna vomit all over your rug.

**Dr. Stanley:**
It's a cheap rug.
Let's talk about what's really going on here.
Hm?

**Patient:**
  It's Andrew. He knows I'm here at this time. Why is he calling me here?

**Dr. Stanley:**
Maybe he's worried. You were out all night.

**Patient:**
Yeah, right. If he really cared, he wouldn't have started with this shit.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Start what?

**Patient:**
At the club with this guy...
Oh, my God.
He had corduroy pants on, preppy sweater.
Republican probably.
  Can I just step out for a second and let him know I'm here?
I can't concentrate with this shit.
Just a sec.

**Dr. Stanley:**
The call can wait.

**Patient:**
 Andrew gave me an ultimatum.
Either we get married or we split.
Said he wants an answer in a day or two at the most, or else he's out.
Said he can't take it any more.
That he loves me, that he doesn't believe I love him, not for real.
That it's been two years already, on and off, blah, blah, blah.
I don't know why. All of a sudden, he just started ranting and raving.
We've talked about this stuff before, but it was all in theory if we stayed together, if.
And suddenly out of the blue, I can't even remember what we were doing...
We were watching TV.
All of a sudden he just gets off the couch, grabs the remote and turns off the TV, and he turns to me and he has tears in his eyes and he says, "That's it, I can't take it any more." So out of line. He promised he'd lay off the subject for a while.
And all of a sudden he's on this crying bullshit.
He actually burst out crying. I've never seen him like that before.
And to tell you the truth it really scared me.
No, it made me angry.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Why?

**Patient:**
He's trying to manipulate me with these cheap chick tricks.
Maybe he thought he would break my heart or something.
Or appeal to my...
Shit, you know, forget it, I don't know.
I threw a tantrum like a three-year-old.
I screamed, cried...
told him to fuck off...
told him he was a little piece of shit for doing this to me when he knows I'm working double shifts at the hospital this week.
I slammed the door, smashed his laptop on the floor, I killed it, I ran out and I called Ilona.
She dressed me in this outfit.
It's, it's not mine.
We went out for a drink at a club that she likes on Chester Street.
She tried to calm me down, put things into perspective.
And she said...
She said that I was lucky...
that she wished somebody had loved her enough to give her an ultimatum.
And then we drank. Well, I drank.
And there's this guy at the bar, and at some point Ilona said that she was tired and that she needed to go home.
And then that guy...
moved next to me, and, erm...
You know what he said?
He said, "You look so sad." And I said, "Really?" And he said, "Yeah, you do. It looks good on you." "Looks good on you." Whatever happened to, "Do you have the time?" or, "Haven't we met before?" I must be totally out of touch, Dr. Stanley.
What do you think? I mean, do I look good when I'm sad?
I don't think anybody looks good when they're sad.
And then, er, I don't know how much I had to drink cos he was ordering for me, of course, and then he paid the bill and he asked me, "Would you like to go somewhere else?" And I said, "Yes, I'd like to go to the bathroom." So I stood up and I went to the bathroom, he follows me.
And you wouldn't believe it but these were unisex bathrooms.
Am I unlucky or what?

**Dr. Stanley:**
How do you mean, unlucky?

**Patient:**
Well, I'm running away from a guy and I'm...

**Dr. Stanley:**
You were trying to get away from the guy.

**Patient:**
I mean, I needed to pee, by myself, I've been doing that since I was three.
So I realise I needed to make a decision.
By following me to the bathroom, this guy was also giving me an ultimatum.
I thought, "Fuck, out of the pan and into the fire." I ran away from one ultimatum, and there was this guy with a hard on giving me another.
Suddenly I felt like doing it.
I never had sex in a bathroom before.
I mean, what, I should go and marry Andrew without ever knowing what a good bathroom fuck's all about?
It's part of a young lady's education, isn't it?

**Dr. Stanley:**
So you wanted to do it but not to get back at Andrew, just for yourself?

**Patient:**
That's right.
A girl being forced into marriage...
what's she supposed to do, die ignorant?
So this guy follows me into the stall and...
suddenly...
I was horny.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Is hearing about this disgusting to you?

**Patient:**
No. It's not disgusting.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Go on.

**Patient:**
He unzipped, pulled down his pants, and he stood there with this...
huge...
Oh, God, I felt like I was 16...
touching it for the very first time.
I was really surprised at how...
warm it felt.
I mean, don't I know that already?
And then he turned me round to face the door...
and he pulled down my stockings.
He lifted up my skirt, put his hand into his back pocket and pulled out a condom.
I realise this guy's very good at this, he does this a lot, he's a real pro.
And then this guy entered the stall next to us and started peeing, and gushes full volume like a racehorse.
And I thought of Andrew...
how... how he pees in the morning, making the same sound.
My heart ached, I just...
It was so stupid, you know, I just felt so sad all of a sudden, and then he's behind me and he's rubbing up against me and he's feeling me up.
And I thought to myself, "It's gonna happen any moment now," and I just...
I just couldn't do it.
I simply closed my legs shut. I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it to Andrew.
I just couldn't do it.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Well, seems like quite a night out.

**Patient:**
Well, yeah, that's not the end of it, because this idiot, I told him, "I'm really sorry but I have a boyfriend, I can't do this." And he says, "Boo-hoo," and he grabs my hands and he says, "Listen, cupcake, you think you can leave me high and dry like this?" Pointing at his dick.
"The least you can do is make it up to me." I said to him, "What do you want? You want some money?" He said, "Give me a hand job "and there'll be no hard feelings." And I said to him, "What's the matter with you? Are you crazy?" And it was just getting really strange. It was tense. His tone changed.
And then...
And then I thought of you.
What you'd say about it.
I thought about us going through this in therapy.
And what did you imagine us saying?
I imagined you not being able to understand it.
That you'd be disgusted.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Is that why you ran over here?
To find out if I would be disgusted?

**Patient:**
I didn't run.
I gave him the hand job.
God. Excuse me.

**Dr. Stanley:**
 You OK?

**Patient:**
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
 Yeah.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Thank you.

**Patient:**
We, erm...
We talked about what happened at the, er, the club last night but we never got back to actually talking about Andrew and that argument yesterday.
I don't wanna be put in this position.
I don't wanna have this power to decide our future for both of us. I just don't.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Do you have any idea why Andrew chose this particular time?

**Patient:**
What do you mean?

**Dr. Stanley:**
Do you think that Andrew, just out of the blue, as you said yourself, came up with this idea of an ultimatum?
Did you notice anything over the last couple of days or weeks that you think might have brought this on?

**Patient:**
Nothing, I don't know. He just lost it.
Shit, don't you know that men are the new women?
Obsessed with weddings and children. And lately he's lost touch with reality.
He thinks I'm seeing someone. That's how this whole thing started. It's unbelievable.

**Dr. Stanley:**
I thought you said it came out of nowhere.
You were watching TV and then suddenly...

**Patient:**
We were watching TV but, before that, we were having dinner and he had this look on his face, this sad look, and I could tell something was up. You can just tell, right?
And I said to him, "What's going on?" And he said, "I don't know what I want, "I just know I don't want this on-and-off thing." So I said to him, "Sure." And then, "Let's just decide, either we get married or we split."

**Dr. Stanley:**
So you were the one who came up with it.

**Patient:**
With what?

**Dr. Stanley:**
The ultimatum.

**Patient:**
No, he's the one.
He had the problem with the on-and-off thing.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Yeah, but on and off can mean several things.
You were the one who made it specific get married or to split up, that was your ultimatum.

**Patient:**
No, no, no, he had this thing with this on and o...

**Dr. Stanley:**
The ultim...

**Patient:**
Yeah, OK. I was the first one to say it, you're right.
But he jumped all over it. I said I didn't know what I want and he said, "You have a day or two max to decide what you want." And I said, "Fine." And then he started crying and blah, blah, blah.
The whole thing was scary to him, I think.

**Dr. Stanley:**
What about you? Weren't you scared?

**Patient:**
Of what?

**Dr. Stanley:**
Of splitting up.

**Patient:**
I wasn't suggesting that we split up. That's not the point.

**Dr. Stanley:**
So what do you think was the point of this argument that you may have initiated?

**Patient:**
I didn't initiate anything.

**Dr. Stanley:**
No, you may not have meant to, but you did.
It sounds like you wanted to bring this relationship into crisis.
I know you say that Andrew hates uncertainties but perhaps you're the one who can't live with them.
Why did you choose this particular time to bring things to a head?

**Patient:**
I did no such thing.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Why now?

**Patient:**
Cos he's right.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Andrew's right.

**Patient:**
I am being unfaithful to him.

**Dr. Stanley:**
You mean what happened last night at the club?

**Patient:**
Not just last night.
I've been unfaithful to him for a long time.

**Dr. Stanley:**
So, why haven't we talked about this before?

**Patient:**
I think we have.
It's been here all along.

**Dr. Stanley:**
You mean to say you've never noticed it?

**Patient:**
You're surprised.

**Dr. Stanley:**
No, I'm not surprised, I just... I don't follow what you mean.

**Patient:**
This isn't...
the reaction I was hoping for.
Not at all.

**Dr. Stanley:**
What was the reaction that you were hoping for?

**Patient:**
I...
I had two scenarios in my head.
In the first one, you stand up and you hug me...
and you say, "I love you.
"Love you too, Laura.
"I've been feeling this way for a long time, "I just wanted you to be the first one to say it." And then we make love.

**Dr. Stanley:**
And the, erm...
the second scenario?

**Patient:**
It's like the first one but...
but without the sex, we just sit here together.
You know, I'm embarrassed to even talk about it.
You're sitting there like a fucking Buddha, acting like you have no idea what I'm talking about. It's humiliating.

**Dr. Stanley:**
How long have you felt like this?

**Patient:**
A year.
From the first session.
I thought it'd go away, I thought, "It's just an infatuation, that's all." But it's getting worse.
You've become the centre of my life.

**Dr. Stanley:**
I'm your therapist.
The parameters and the limitations...
are established and ethically defined.
I'm not an option.
You may be using me as a...
as an excuse to bail from your relationship with, with Andrew.

**Patient:**
You know why I didn't fuck that guy?
Not because of Andrew, not because I didn't wanna cheat on him, I do wanna cheat on him, but with you.
When I was sitting there at the bar by myself, I was thinking, "What would happen if you were to walk in?" You'd walk in, you'd sit next to me at the bar, you'd order a drink.
I even tried to imagine what you would order.
A shot of bourbon, maybe, something expensive, something fancy.
Then we'd start talking.
"What a coincidence it is to meet like this, "how awkward it is to meet outside the office." And then, without words, because we talk enough when we're here...
you motion for me to follow you to the bathroom.
And I do.
When I went into the stall with that guy...
I imagined it was you behind me.
That's what made it so exciting.
Then that guy started peeing and it woke me up and I realised that it's impossible.
I know it, I understand it. I tell myself that every time I walk out of here.
I know it, I understand it but I'm not sure that my body understands it.
I know it can never happen, I know.
So don't worry, I'm not gonna start showing up here, I'm not gonna start stalking you like...
Glenn Close in that movie.
I'm not gonna boil your kid's rabbit.
I'm not dangerous.
At least not to you.
God, how can I go back to my life?
To the hospital, to Andrew.
Not to Andrew when the only thing that matters to me is you.

**Dr. Stanley:**
 Our time's up.

**Patient:**
Yes, it is.
I feel like I came here in the dark and I'm leaving into a bigger darkness.
What am I gonna do now?

**Dr. Stanley:**
We'll talk about it next week.
OK?
I'll call you a taxi.

**Patient:**
No, I'm fine.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Are you sure?
How are you going to get home?

--- End of transcript ---
--- Beginning of transcript ---
**Patient:**
So, are there any rules?

**Dr. Stanley:**
Er, rules?

**Patient:**
Ground rules.
Anything I should know before we start?

**Dr. Stanley:**
Oh, not really.
It's more or less up to you.

**Patient:**
Oh, right, right. I'm a customer.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Yeah.
Though in my profession, we say that the customer is always wrong.
It's a... It's a therapist's joke.

**Patient:**
So, do you recognise me?
No.
I'm sorry, uh, should I?
I was told you were the best, a man in tune with everything around him,
so you should.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Thank you.
But I do think that in this profession, "the best" is really a matter of personal opinion.
No, the best can be established by facts and figures.

**Patient:**
You're the best. I did my research.
Couple of former patients, someone who knew you from graduate school.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Does that pressure you?
Is it important for you to know
that I am the best?

**Patient:**
Yes.
It's nothing personal, I always go to the best - dentists, mechanics.
You know what they say - save now, pay later.

**Dr. Stanley:**
So what do you think being the best therapist entails?

**Patient:**
Do you recognise me?

**Dr. Stanley:**
No, I...
I... I don't.

**Patient:**
Let me help.
The Madrasah Murderer.
Does that mean anything to you?

**Dr. Stanley:**
No.

**Patient:**
It wasn't that long ago.
US Navy aircraft hit a target on the outskirts of Baghdad.
Naval Intelligence identified the structure as an insurgents' safe house, a bunker. Turns out it's a madrasah.
Let me tell you what that is. It's an Islamic religious school.
Boys like bees in a beehive studying the Koran.
16 of them... dead.
Rings a bell?

**Dr. Stanley:**
Yes, I remember that, yes.

**Patient:**
So, that's me.
I flew that mission.
The Madrasah Murderer.
So, uh, do you surf the net?

**Dr. Stanley:**
Well, somehow... Well, it wasn't really somehow, it was...

**Patient:**
Let's call a spade a spade. A leak. Probably another intelligence fuck-up.
Anyway, I was identified as the pilot in that mission and my photo was placed on fundamentalist websites.
And I'm not talking Al Jazeera, I'm talking websites that are...
asking for my head on a platter.
Offering up the heavens and 40 virgins to anyone who will slit my throat from ear to ear.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Here, um...

**Patient:**
Here you are. It's not a recent photo. It's a photo taken when I was 18.
On a high-school trip to Europe, Holland.
That city with the miniatures. Ult... Utrecht.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Utrecht.

**Patient:**
Right.
So while I'm talking to you, a million fanatics are downloading my portrait and printing it out as a dartboard.
Silly motherfuckers.

**Dr. Stanley:**
So, why have you come to see me?

**Patient:**
Whoa, whoa. We'll get to that.
So you're probably thinking, "What's it like?
"He flew his mission, then he flew back "and he saw the bodies of those children on CNN." You're probably trying to figure out what went through his head.
Let me tell you, after that kind of mission, I don't watch CNN.
I go to sleep.
I'm dead tired.
And you're probably dying to ask how I can sleep nights.
OK, um...

**Dr. Stanley:**
How do you sleep?

**Patient:**
I sleep well, thank you very much, knowing it was mission accomplished and with great precision.
I followed my orders, which were hit my target and hit it on time.
Time and target. Do you know, we have to hit our targets within two seconds of the estimated time?
It's surgical. And that's one small window and I have never missed it.
If I had failed that task, I'd be in trouble with my superiors, with my conscience and with the system.
But I hit my target.
So, I sleep like a baby.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Um, h-how many...
children...
died in this... in this mission?

**Patient:**
The media puts it at 16.

**Dr. Stanley:**
And the air force?

**Patient:**
The navy, Doctor, listen.
The navy says nothing and why should it?
We're not into body counts, we just hit targets.
We don't look back over our shoulder.
We do our thing so you can sit here in peace, talking to people for a living.

**Dr. Stanley:**
 So when did you hear that children had been killed?

**Patient:**
The following afternoon. I heard it on the internet.

**Dr. Stanley:**
What exactly did you hear?
Anything specifically that you remember?

**Patient:**
Like what? It's not like there's time in the day to be surfing the net, this was a moment, I got away.
There's a lot of stuff to keep me busy.

**Dr. Stanley:**
What kind of stuff?

**Patient:**
Mission review, aerial photos, videos. Just data, stuff.
Preparation versus execution.
Every tiny technical aspect of our flight is recorded and analysed by the man.
There's nowhere to hide. And that's the way it should be.
It's just stuff and more stuff.
When my mother died, my father had a year's worth of stuff to deal with.
Last will and testament, her office, garden, a lifetime of photo albums.
And every time I talked to him, I'd ask how he was, expecting, uh...
you know, that... he'd break down.
Finally.
"It never ends, Alex, it never ends. Your mother left such a mess.
"She didn't know she was gonna die." And that's all he said.
After less than a year, he met another woman and got married, just like that.

**Dr. Stanley:**
How did that make you feel?

**Patient:**
Well, surprised. A whole life together and not a single tear.
Mm.

**Dr. Stanley:**
It's interesting that you compare the death of your mother with this mission that you've just flown.

**Patient:**
That's very clever of you.
But there's no relation whatsoever.
My mother's death was the most traumatic event in my life so far.
That mission was just another mission for Alex. There is no comparison.
Anyway, look, that's over and I'm back now at my home base and now I'm on R&R.

**Dr. Stanley:**
What kind of things do you do for R&R?

**Patient:**
Don't try to get ahead of me.
I'm a runner. I was a hell of a runner in high school and I'm still a good one for an old man. So, I run with my fairy friend.
This gay guy who could kick your ass at any sport.

**Dr. Stanley:**
And does he have a name, this friend?

**Patient:**
Mm.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Daniel.

**Patient:**
Daniel.
We've been running together for a long time, between six and ten miles.
Depending on whether one of us is on his period. Only this time, I challenged him.
It was no good running in the Middle East, not for the US military, unless you want a bomb to blow your balls off!
So, I wanted to do some serious running. I said, "Let's go for 15." After 15 miles, I said, "20." He didn't want it.
I said, "OK, I'll go on my own." So, he followed.
I said, "You know, only six more and it's a marathon. Let's do it." He wanted to stop. Little bitch.
But I wasn't gonna stop.
No stop.
We were out of water, we were on fumes.
At 22 miles, I had a heart attack and died.
A textbook case, straight out of med school.
Enlargement of the left ventricle, in accordance with the family history on both sides, fatal.
According to the EKG and according to statistics, I had a 97.3 per cent chance of dying.
Or a 2.7 per cent chance of living. Anyway, dead.

**Dr. Stanley:**
You actually died?

**Patient:**
In the clinical sense no pulse, no brain activity, total clinical death.
But here I am.
Now I'm gonna disappoint you, Doctor.
Wanna know why I'm gonna disappoint you?
Let me help you - the light, the tunnel, life flashing before my eyes.
That's what you're interested in, right?

**Dr. Stanley:**
No, I wasn't actually thinking of that at all, but I am interested.
Tell me.

**Patient:**
I couldn't give a shit about it either.
But that's all everyone wanted to know about - my father, my wife.
Everyone wanted to hear about the goddamn tunnel.
Just such bullshit.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Do you feel that maybe you disappointed people by not having that experience?
That maybe in some way you failed to deliver the goods?

**Patient:**
Nobody really knows what was going through my mind during those last few moments.
As soon as there was no more tunnel, no one was interested.

**Dr. Stanley:**
And what was going through your mind?

**Patient:**
Oh, I knew what was happening, you can tell.
And you're afraid it's the end.
In all that time until I lost consciousness...
All that time... I don't know, it was maybe seconds, maybe half a minute.
All that time I kept trying to figure out if I had a hard-on.
I don't know how I remembered, it was something my grandmother told me, when I was in high school, and she said when Grandpa died, she found him lying naked in the bathtub with a huge erection.
Now, he's... he was 92 years old.
She hadn't seen an erection like that in 20 years.
She liked it. She said that was God's final gift to a man.
A dead man's boner. They call it angel lust.
Anyway, I'm lying there thinking about that story.
I know what's happening and I said to myself, "God Almighty, just don't let me have an erection now, not a hard-on." Because if you had an erection, it would mean...
That would mean that I was dead.

**Dr. Stanley:**
And your friend Daniel was with you throughout this?

**Patient:**
Yeah, resuscitation, CPR... Daniel's a doctor. I forgot to say that.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Oh. For a minute I thought you were going to say something else, that perhaps your fear of an erection was associated with the presence of your friend, Daniel.

**Patient:**
Excuse me?
You're exaggerating. I explained something simple, a dead man's erection - what's that got to do with Daniel?

**Dr. Stanley:**
Well, maybe I didn't make myself clear earlier on when I was talking about the customer always being wrong.
What I meant was that sometimes the patient hides things from his therapist, from himself.
And so part of our job is to uncover the things that we hide.

**Patient:**
 So, my secret is I'm afraid of homosexuals?

**Dr. Stanley:**
No, not necessarily. But I just wanted to clarify that.

**Patient:**
Yeah, that's neither here nor there. I want to get to my point.
I didn't have the erection, so relax.
But I remember very vividly that moment just before passing out, before losing consciousness.
Losing consciousness, that's a funny expression.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Why do you think that's a funny expression?

**Patient:**
Losing consciousness - it's an expression my father would use.
Everything in terms of profits and loss.
Fits him like a glove.

**Dr. Stanley:**
So something about how you describe your last moments is equated with your father's seeing things in terms of profit and loss?

**Patient:**
OK, OK, with all due respect, I think we've come to this way too early.
The father-son relationship stuff shouldn't come up so soon.

**Dr. Stanley:**
You think it's too soon?

**Patient:**
Forget what I feel.
I know it's too soon. I wanna know what you think.

**Dr. Stanley:**
So you're... You're testing me?

**Patient:**
I'm entitled to some testing. I'm paying.
Actually, I think you've been testing me since you walked in.
You've asked about me and my reputation, you ask, you practically demand that I ask certain questions that you think I am dying to ask.

**Dr. Stanley:**
It's important to you, I think, that I adhere to certain standards you set before you walked through the door.

**Patient:**
What's wrong with that? Look, I did my research.
It's a 1  1/2 hour drive to get here and I'm paying you good money.
And I'm expected to tell you, a perfect stranger, the most intimate things about my life.
Plus there are risks here.
It's not like the navy's gonna give me a medal for spilling my guts, I'm not gonna open up to you without knowing what you are.

**Dr. Stanley:**
And what do you expect to find?
How are we going to know that I'm a good enough therapist for you?

**Patient:**
I'll know...
according to your opinion.

**Dr. Stanley:**
My opinion of what?

**Patient:**
Of the issue I came to talk about.
But I'll come to that in a minute.
It's to do with what happened after taking me out of the freezer.

**Dr. Stanley:**
The freezer?

**Patient:**
Oh, you mean that you were grounded?
No, literally frozen. They froze me.
The mobile intensive care unit arrived and put me in a suit that freezes you.
They got one no more than three-quarters of a mile from where I collapsed.
And their ER is tops.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Let's go back to this...

**Patient:**
We're getting there. You have no patience.
I was told you're a good listener.
Now look, it works on a very simple principle.
It reduces the shock to the body's systems by dropping the body temperature.

**Dr. Stanley:**
So how long were you...

**Patient:**
In my case, 48 hours. It's a record.
There's no history of anyone who's been in that suit for such a long time.
I guess I went a long way up that tunnel.

**Dr. Stanley:**
The tunnel that wasn't there?

**Patient:**
No, unfortunately not.

**Dr. Stanley:**
So tell me what you remember about this 48 hours.

**Patient:**
Mostly I remember, um... a terrible fatigue.
I guess that's why they call it "dead tired".
It's physical, but mainly mental exhaustion.
And I remember very clearly the relief I felt when I succeeded in coming back over into the 
world.

**Dr. Stanley:**
You say that you succeeded in coming back to this world.
Did... Did you feel it was under your control?

**Patient:**
What are you trying to get at?

**Dr. Stanley:**
I'm not trying to get at anything.
But what you're describing is a strong will to live.

**Patient:**
During this experience, there was a decision to go on living.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Despite having made this effort to live...
everybody's disappointed.
It's not every day people meet someone who's come back from the dead.
It's a one-in-a-million thing. And if you don't supply the goods, then...
Listen, I have never spent a day in my life in a hospital.
You get it? Never.

**Dr. Stanley:**
So, perhaps your anger isn't directed at those people interested in the tunnel.
Perhaps you're angry at yourself. How your body betrayed you.
This is a systems failure that was not supposed to happen to somebody like you.

**Patient:**
Hmh.
I have a brother, who's not bright, he's a real-estate agent.
Anyway, he's a great athlete. And he once proved to me, and he does his research, believe me...
that all the great quarterbacks in the history of football were also the best looking.
Namath, Staubach, Cunningham, they're all good-Iooking people.
The best-Iooking students in the class are often great athletes.

**Dr. Stanley:**
You know why that is?

**Patient:**
I've no idea.
It's got nothing to do with sports.
When they got their gift from God the Father, or whoever the hell doles out the talent, they got the whole package - beauty, talent, character.
That's how it is. It's an evolutionary thing.

**Dr. Stanley:**
So, how is your football?

**Patient:**
Nah.
Football's not my game. Running, of course.
Wrestling. Pole vault, once upon a time.
But now, I am part of a military elite.
Athletes may be popular, but we are the creme de la creme.
You have to understand, this is a person whose whole life was perfect.
People in my line of work are born to excel, to be perfect.
It wasn't our choice, it was life that chose us to be the best.
And what does that mean? "Life chose us?" Yeah, you don't become a fighter pilot suddenly at age 20.
At age seven or eight, when you're in the third grade, you know you're talented.
You know you're headed somewhere special, you are going to be the best and it all lays out right in front of you.
Top grades, varsity letters, you name it.
I'm a TOPGUN grad, you understand that? That training is not for pussies.

**Dr. Stanley:**
So if you don't achieve your personal best,
are you disappointed in yourself?

**Patient:**
No, no, that's not...
How much longer do we have?

**Dr. Stanley:**
We've got time. I'II...
I'll tell you when it's... when it's time.

**Patient:**
OK, so here's my point, finally.
I came to get your advice on something.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Sure.

**Patient:**
I decided to go there. To the target.
You understand what I'm talking about here?

**Dr. Stanley:**
You mean to the site where you dropped the bomb, to the school?

**Patient:**
Madrasah. I wanna go back, take a look around.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Where the children were killed?

**Patient:**
I know what you're thinking, so let me straighten this out.
I don't have a guilty conscience, I already told you that. I sleep very well.

**Dr. Stanley:**
But why would you want to go back?

**Patient:**
I'm interested.
From the moment I came out of that freezer, I knew I wanted to go back.
It came up in a conversation I had with Daniel when he visited me at the hospital.
He thinks I'm gonna freak out or something, he thinks it's a crazy thing to do.
And he said I need to see someone first - psychologist, psychiatrist.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Don't you think it's dangerous?

**Patient:**
Not at all.
I don't think anyone would recognise me.

**Dr. Stanley:**
But your picture's on the internet.

**Patient:**
No way. You saw the picture.
It's ridiculous. My mother wouldn't recognise me, not even Michaela.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Who's Michaela?

**Patient:**
My wife.

**Dr. Stanley:**
What does she think of all this?

**Patient:**
What's she got to do with it?

**Dr. Stanley:**
Don't you talk with your wife?

**Patient:**
This is not for me, all this "What do you feel? What do you think?" I asked you something, I came to you to consult about something specific.
So, you want me to tell you that this desire of yours to go back to where the bombing took place is a good thing?

**Dr. Stanley:**
OK, yeah, yeah. Yes.
Do you want me to take responsibility for this visit?

**Patient:**
OK, don't make me into an idiot. Are you telling me I'm not taking responsibility?

**Dr. Stanley:**
No, I'm just going back to something you said earlier on.
Remember you said that life chose you to be a member of an elite, that it wasn't your decision?
Maybe that's an attitude you're comfortable with.
You're comfortable with it because you don't have to make any decisions.
It relieves you of responsibility.
Your commanding officer, he makes the decisions, conveys them to you and you execute them.

**Patient:**
Wait, are you trying to tell me that I'm asking you to be my commanding officer?

**Dr. Stanley:**
OK, I'll buy it.

**Patient:**
So, are you willing to... to be my CO?
For $150 an hour.

**Dr. Stanley:**
I don't think I'm... I don't think I'm qualified for that.

**Patient:**
But would you agree to be your own commanding officer?

**Dr. Stanley:**
Oh, listen, you know what? Just leave it alone. I...
I'm not gonna get anything useful out of you.

**Patient:**
And you're supposed to be the best?

**Dr. Stanley:**
I'm not the best.
Maybe you're the best. But I'm... I'm not.
Think about the ramifications of what you're about to do.
You're going back to a place where you dropped a bomb, 16 children were killed, your face is on the internet and there's a price on your head.

**Patient:**
Wait. Now you're saying you agree with Daniel, that I've gone crazy?
How would you feel if I did agree?

**Dr. Stanley:**
How hard is a straight answer?

**Patient:**
I got a plane to catch.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Why? Where... Where are you going?

**Patient:**
Are you not listening to me? I am going back there.
Nonstop, DC to Frankfurt. Then Frankfurt-Amman.
Thursday morning, by charter, to Baghdad.

**Dr. Stanley:**
You're leaving tonight?

**Patient:**
Good morning, Doctor!
I'm going back as part of a church group, a charity, and we're visiting those neighbourhoods.
No, this is not part of navy protocol.

**Dr. Stanley:**
May I ask you something? When you were running with Daniel, 22 miles?

**Patient:**
Mm.

**Dr. Stanley:**
How long did that take?

**Patient:**
I don't know, almost three hours.
Daniel wanted to quit.
He's always going on about optimum pulse during exercise.
He thought we shouldn't go over 85 per cent.

**Dr. Stanley:**
You know what I find interesting?
That shortly after you complete this mission, you go on leave and against the advice of your best friend, who also happens to be a medical doctor, you work yourself up into a state of extreme exertion.
It's as if you were avoiding going back to active duty.

**Patient:**
No, I have no problem flying again. In fact, I'm dying to get back in action.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Do you not see a connection between your collapse and what went before?

**Patient:**
Now, I know you say you don't have any guilt feelings.

**Dr. Stanley:**
But don't you think there's a strong desire there to atone for your actions?

**Patient:**
Do you have any coffee round here?
I could use a good cup of coffee.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Um, our time is up, I'm afraid.

**Patient:**
I still got things I wanna talk about.

**Dr. Stanley:**
I'm happy to see you again.
It...
 I think it's important that you keep talking about all this.

**Patient:**
OK, I'll keep that in mind.
I'd better pay you now. Who knows how this little trip will turn out?

**Dr. Stanley:**
You're serious about travelling today?

**Patient:**
It's this way. I'll write you an invoice for the...

**Dr. Stanley:**
Don't worry about it.

**Patient:**
Aren't you gonna wish me luck?

**Dr. Stanley:**
Yes.
Good luck.

--- End of transcript ---
--- Beginning of transcript ---
**Patient:**
I couldn't open the door.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Oh, I'm sorry. It gets, uh...
It gets stuck. Hi. I'm Dr. Stanley.

**Patient:**
Sophie.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Nice to meet you. Come on in.

**Patient:**
Here?

**Dr. Stanley:**
Yes.
Do you need any help with the...

**Patient:**
No. It's OK.
Anna Colden recommended that I talk to you.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Anna Colden?

**Patient:**
She's my lawyer. She heard about you from a friend of yours.
I mean, a friend of hers, not a friend of yours.
From a patient of yours who is a friend of hers. Sorry.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Mm. So, Anna Colden recommended you through a patient.

**Patient:**
Do you know his name?

**Dr. Stanley:**
I don't know.
So what did Anna recommend me for?

**Patient:**
After my accident... I told you on the phone about the accident?

**Dr. Stanley:**
Yes.

**Patient:**
They told me I need the opinion of a psychiatrist because the insurance company of the car that hit me has a problem with my injuries or...
something like that. So that's why I'm here.
I'm here for your professional opinion, not for...

**Dr. Stanley:**
Not for... Not for therapy?
So, let's see if I'm, uh... if I'm getting this right.
Are you suing the insurance company of the person who hit you?

**Patient:**
No. Their insurance company had me talk to a social worker.
And... she started asking me all sorts of annoying questions.
She was really annoying so I refused to talk to her.
She started talking to me like she knew me, so I refused to talk and that didn't go over so well, so my mother said it would be better if I came to talk to you.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Right. So what happened at the accident that requires a psychiatric opinion?

**Patient:**
I really don't remember what happened.
I was on my bicycle and a car ran into me and I don't remember what happened next.

**Dr. Stanley:**
What did they tell you afterwards?

**Patient:**
That I flew my bike right into the street.

**Dr. Stanley:**
You're... You're laughing at that.

**Patient:**
What that sounds like, flying straight into the street.

**Dr. Stanley:**
So you find that funny, yeah?

**Patient:**
Because it reminds me of something about two years ago.
A... A friend of mine, he took me out on this motorbike and he stopped to get something at a convenience store.
Anyway, I was really bored so I pretended that I knew how to drive it.
You put your hands on the handlebars and go like this.
Well, it was one of those monster bikes.
Just by turning the handle a little, it just flies.
So, suddenly, I'm like, zoom, and it takes off.
My head, it whips back like this and when I look down, I realise I'm riding into the street.
Totally crashed into a car.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Oh.

**Patient:**
There was this old woman standing nearby and she saw all this. "I saw her. She did it on purpose.
"She tried to kill herself. She tried to kill herself." That's what she was yelling?
Yeah, she was like a crazy woman.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Oh.
Course, it couldn't have been that funny when it happened, I'm sure?

**Patient:**
No. Not really.
I wanted to kill her. I was just lying there.
I couldn't move. I couldn't do anything.
I wanted to yell, "Shut up, you... you idiot.
"Why are you screaming?" You know? But I couldn't speak.
It's like this feeling...
when somebody says something about you and you can't defend yourself.
It's totally unfair.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Like that social worker you were talking about.

**Patient:**
What does she have to do with it?

**Dr. Stanley:**
Well, didn't you feel that she was speaking for you?

**Patient:**
Yeah, but I could have said something.
I just didn't want to.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Hm.
So, tell me a little more about this, uh, this accident.

**Patient:**
It's all in that report.

Where did it happen?

**Patient:**
In a gas station on Madison near the gym where I train.

**Dr. Stanley:**
So you were on the way to the gym?

**Patient:**
I don't know. I told you I don't remember anything.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Do you feel comfortable talking about yourself?

**Patient:**
No.
My name is Sophie. I'm 16 years old.
I've been a gymnast since the age of six and a half.
I was US junior champion at the age of 12.
I'm an only child.
I don't know. What do you wanna know?
In another few months are the national trials.
Last chance to qualify for the Olympics.
I'm kind of like... an Olympic hopeful.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Wow.
That's really impressive. Congratulations.

**Patient:**
Thank you.

**Dr. Stanley:**
So how is life in general?

**Patient:**
What?

**Dr. Stanley:**
Well, apart from the gymnastics.
How's life?

**Patient:**
It's great.
I just don't have the energy for This Is Your Life right now.

**Dr. Stanley:**
This Is Your Life? What do... What do you mean?

**Patient:**
You know, like the TV show.

**Dr. Stanley:**
You're way too young to know about that show.

**Patient:**
It's on DVD. My mom's friend watches it all the time.

**Dr. Stanley:**
What do you think of it?

**Patient:**
It's OK.
Some of the people on it are so old.

**Dr. Stanley:**
 Why do you think they put old people on that?

**Patient:**
I don't know. Cos they have nothing better to do?
They're retired and dying off fast so they put them on the show before it's too late.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Oh.

**Patient:**
So do you think you can help me with this professional opinion or not?

**Dr. Stanley:**
It's not that simple.

**Patient:**
Why not?

**Dr. Stanley:**
Because it's not like an X-ray where you can take photographs, look at the results and then you go on your way.
It doesn't quite work like that.

**Patient:**
OK.
OK, so I guess I'll leave.
Would you at least like to read what it says in the report?

**Dr. Stanley:**
If you want me to.

**Patient:**
Like you already know what it says?

**Dr. Stanley:**
No. I've no idea what it says.

**Patient:**
Listen, I didn't come here to talk about myself.
I just need your opinion.

**Dr. Stanley:**
So you want me to give you my opinion based on what I read and the conversation that we've had today, is that it?

**Patient:**
Is that a problem?

**Dr. Stanley:**
No. No.
I'll write up an opinion and, um...
when you come next week, you can decide whether you want to use it or not.

**Patient:**
Just like that, without any more questions?

**Dr. Stanley:**
Well, what kind of questions do you want me to ask?

**Patient:**
I don't know. Shrink-like questions.
Say, about Mom, Dad, that kind of thing?
Doesn't sound like you're interested.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Why would you say that?
I am very interested in everything that you have to say.
I mean that.

**Patient:**
You spoke to my mother already, didn't you?

**Dr. Stanley:**
I didn't.

**Patient:**
You already know what it says in there.

**Dr. Stanley:**
I've never spoken to her.

**Patient:**
You did and you're letting me sit here and you know exactly what's in that envelope.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Was I... Was I supposed to talk to her?

**Patient:**
What, did you, like, plan everything?
Like I'm some kind of idiot, you planned some charade?
What's the point? Whatever. She would send me to someone like you.
I should have listened to my father. He called them a cult of crazies.
Open the door for me, please.

**Dr. Stanley:**
And if I did speak to your mom?

**Patient:**
I knew it.

**Dr. Stanley:**
So what, then?

**Patient:**
It means you're a liar, OK?
Cos I know how it's supposed to work.
You're supposed to read that report and ask the stupid shrink questions you ask.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Doesn't it seems unprofessional to so not do it that way?
Maybe I have something to say about what it says in there.
I just wanted to read the report by myself before our meeting next week. That's all.

**Patient:**
What meeting next week?

**Dr. Stanley:**
I'd like us to meet three or four times for me to form an opinion of you, to get to know you a little.
Don't you think?
Otherwise... it wouldn't be professional.
Hm?
I'll read it now.
OK?
So are all these ships instead of sailing for real?

**Patient:**
Uh-huh.

**Dr. Stanley:**
At least you won't get seasick.

**Patient:**
Oh...
I don't know about that.

**Dr. Stanley:**
What do you mean?

**Patient:**
Sometimes I can get quite wobbly just sitting right here.
You have to make a round window to the outside.
Then you'll feel like you're in a real ship.
Did you really read all those books or is it just to make an impression?

**Dr. Stanley:**
Uh-huh.

**Patient:**
Yes, you read them or yes, you're trying to make an impression?

**Dr. Stanley:**
Yes.
I've read them.
I feel sorry for the books up there.

**Patient:**
Oh. Why do you feel sorry for them?

**Dr. Stanley:**
Where would you put them?

**Patient:**
I don't know. They're your fucking books.

**Dr. Stanley:**
You suffer from asthma.

**Patient:**
Yeah. How do you know that?

**Dr. Stanley:**
There's an inhaler here.

**Patient:**
Oh, thanks. I've been looking everywhere for that. Thank you.

**Dr. Stanley:**
So what, you could have died without it?
According to what it says here...
it looks like you could have died too.

**Patient:**
Yeah. That would have solved a lot of problems.

**Dr. Stanley:**
What would it solve?

**Patient:**
Nothing. I didn't mean anything by it.
Can I talk to you like a normal person?
Do you drive your daughter crazy with questions like this too?

**Dr. Stanley:**
Much more crazy, believe me.
How d'you know I had a daughter?

**Patient:**
Because you do.
You know my mother.
You were on the PTA committee at Arlington elementary.
I was there before I went off to a private school.
I was in the same year as your daughter.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Well, why didn't you tell me that before?

**Patient:**
Hm.

**Dr. Stanley:**
You said that the, uh... that the social worker spoke to you like she knew you.

**Patient:**
She was such a retard.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Did she ask you if, um... if you think about death a lot?

**Patient:**
How did you know that?

**Dr. Stanley:**
According to what it says here, she was trying to prove that the accident was your fault.
It's a good thing you didn't answer any of her questions.
By the way, everybody thinks about death.
I bet she didn't say that, though.
Did she ask you if you had any specific thoughts about death?

**Patient:**
No.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Do you?

**Patient:**
Do I what?
Everyone... Everyone thinks about death and, uh...
imagines how it will come to them.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Do you have any more specific thoughts about it?
I mean, maybe you have certain thoughts that you'd like to talk about.

**Patient:**
Unless you're worried about what I...

**Dr. Stanley:**
I'm not worried.

**Patient:**
OK.
Is this how it's going to be for three appointments?

**Dr. Stanley:**
Is this a little difficult for you?

**Patient:**
No.
Can I have some water?

**Dr. Stanley:**
Sure.

**Patient:**
Oh.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Hang on a minute.
Sorry about this. It's for my little patients, the elves.
It's a bendy one.
You need help with that?
Must be really hard to be, uh... be handicapped like that.
What's the hardest thing about it?

**Patient:**
Everyone treats me like a baby.
Hm.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Did you come here by yourself today?

**Patient:**
Yes. By bus.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Your mom didn't offer to drive you?
Yeah, right. She knew there was no chance I'd say yes.
Before, when you got angry, when, uh...
when you thought that she'd called me, I asked myself, "Why didn't she call?" It makes sense that she would call me first.

**Dr. Stanley:**
I don't... What do you mean?
I'm trying to figure out why you got so angry when you thought...

**Patient:**
I don't get it. She did call?

**Dr. Stanley:**
No, no.

**Patient:**
Did she call or not? Tell me already.

**Dr. Stanley:**
No, she didn't call.

**Patient:**
So why are we back to this again?

**Dr. Stanley:**
Because I got the feeling that when you got angry, you wanted your mother to call, just so that 
you could get angry with her.

**Patient:**
You have no idea what I'm looking for.
You just don't get it.

**Dr. Stanley:**
OK.
So...
why don't you explain it to me, then?

**Patient:**
She thinks that what's written there is true.

**Dr. Stanley:**
What's true?

**Patient:**
Whatever it says. "Suicidal tendencies", blah, blah, blah.

**Dr. Stanley:**
That's what your mother says is true?

**Patient:**
She thinks that this accident is an opportunity to get rid of the sports thing.
That's what she calls it.

**Dr. Stanley:**
But what does that have to do with this report?

**Patient:**
She's afraid.
She doesn't believe that...
She thinks that, because of all this competition and perfectionism, she thinks that I wanted to kill myself. And that's bullshit.
It's been like this for years.
I've been under pressure for years and she has never supported me.
All the other mothers are right there, all over us, visiting the gym, the training camps, all of it.
And the only thing she has to say is, "What do you need this for?" It's obvious she doesn't understand anything.
All this pressure, it doesn't make any difference.
It's so silly. Why would I hurt myself now, just before the nationals when I have all the...
And if I fail the lawsuit, I really have no chance.

**Dr. Stanley:**
What do you mean, fail? Do you see this as a kind of test?
Tell me, why do you...

**Patient:**
Why are you making it sound like it's...

**Dr. Stanley:**
What?

**Patient:**
I didn't come here for therapy.
I just need you to write your opinion and tell me that I'm perfectly all right and tell them that I'm not some crazy who flies into cars every day.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Is that why you came here today?
For me to tell you that you're all right, that you're not crazy?
Is that the test you're afraid of failing?

**Patient:**
I have to go.
It's ten to already.

**Dr. Stanley:**
You probably have to turn on your cellphone now.

**Patient:**
Why? Are you worried that I won't be available?

**Dr. Stanley:**
No.

**Patient:**
Are you this much of a pain in the ass with your daughter?

**Dr. Stanley:**
Much, much worse, believe me.
And yes, I do try to understand my daughter, if that's what you're asking.

**Patient:**
That's not what I'm asking.
Let's say she wants to talk to you now.
What will she do? I don't think she'll wait till ten to so she can talk to you.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Who do you call?

**Patient:**
Now you don't feel comfortable talking about your daughter.

**Dr. Stanley:**
She calls me at ten minutes before the hour, she leaves a message and I get back to her.
But who do you call?

**Patient:**
Who do I call for what?

**Dr. Stanley:**
When you need to talk to someone.

**Patient:**
Four, one, one.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Four, one, one?

**Patient:**
Yeah.
He's my father. He's moved so many times in the past few years, I can never remember his latest phone number.
It's like a family joke. We call four, one, one.

**Dr. Stanley:**
How do you get on with your dad?

**Patient:**
He's always there for me.

**Dr. Stanley:**
What do you mean, he's always there for you?

**Patient:**
He's there. He knows what's happening to me.
When I had the accident, he called me when I was in the ambulance.
He knew something had happened. That's what they told me.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Oh. So is it like you guys have a kind of telepathy together?

**Patient:**
He's the only person in this world who truly loves me and the only one that believes that the accident was not my fault.
The only one except Cy.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Who's Cy?

**Patient:**
This is Cy.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Cy is a mermaid?

**Patient:**
No, Cy drew it.
He's my coach. Dana coloured it, that's his daughter.
I used to be her baby-sitter.
Do I have to go now?

**Dr. Stanley:**
Yes.
So you baby-sit for your coach?

**Patient:**
Yeah, since before I joined his gym.

**Dr. Stanley:**
Oh. So Cy is the only one, apart from your dad, who loves you?
Or he's the only one who thinks that you didn't crash your bike on purpose?

**Patient:**
I don't know. Is that important for your professional opinion?

**Dr. Stanley:**
OK.
I'll tell you what I want us to do.
I would like, before our next meeting, for us to do some homework.
We both write up our opinion of what's in that report.
What do you say?

**Patient:**
How am I supposed to write like this?

**Dr. Stanley:**
Well, you can get somebody to help you.
You can do it on tape, if you like.

**Patient:**
What am I supposed to write?

**Dr. Stanley:**
Your own opinion, your own assessment of what's in there.
What do you say?

**Patient:**
I don't think so.
I think you can do it.
This way.

**Dr. Stanley:**
So, will you try?

**Patient:**
We'll see.
