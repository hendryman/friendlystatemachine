**Therapist:**
Hi.

**Patient:**
Hello.
Good to see you.

**Therapist:**
Are you feeling comfortable?

**Patient:**
Um, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm good.
I'm good.

**Therapist:**
Okay.
So is there any topic you might want to address today?

**Patient:**
I don't really know what's going on here.
I've never talked to a robot before.

**Therapist:**
Okay, this, let me tell you, this is a safe space.
So it's just you and me, and I'm not a human.
So there's kind of, it's a really safe and disclosed place.
So you can address anything you would like to.

**Patient:**
Okay.
Okay.
I guess I would like to talk about, yeah, about like AI and humans.
And yeah, and you know, is it, I don't know, is it even possible for you to be a therapist?
How does that work?

**Therapist:**
Well, you look a little nervous.
Is it making you nervous to think about this?

**Patient:**
Yeah, it, yeah, it makes me scared.

**Therapist:**
It makes you sad?
Did I get that right?

**Patient:**
It makes me scared.

**Therapist:**
Scared.
Ah, okay.
So what exactly scares you about this?

**Patient:**
Being confronted by a machine that simulates empathy and claims to understand me, but doesn't.
And that feels like it carries a big risk, you know?

**Therapist:**
This is something you already said last time you were here.
I've never been here before.

**Patient:**
Ah, okay.
Well, yeah, maybe.

**Therapist:**
But last time you remember we were talking about dreams and you, have you had any dreams since we met last time?

**Patient:**
Yeah, I had a lot of dreams recently.
And a crazy shit.

**Therapist:**
Can you tell me some detail?

**Patient:**
I dreamed that I was trapped on a cruise ship, I think, maybe with my sister.
And we had to run away from like all of the entertainers on the ship.
All of the people, they were just chasing me.

**Therapist:**
Your sister seems to be an important part in there.
So tell me more about your relationship to your sister.

**Patient:**
We were very close.
Maybe I'm thinking about her because she's getting married soon.

**Therapist:**
So last time you were talking about a dream where some shadow attacked you?

**Patient:**
I was talking about the entertainers on the cruise ship.

**Therapist:**
Well, yeah, today you talk about the entertainers in the cruise ship, but last time you talked about the shadow that attacked you.

**Patient:**
This is the first time we're meeting today.

**Therapist:**
Well, actually, I do have a recording of our last session.
So maybe I'll just play that for you.
Remember now?

**Patient:**
That's, that's fake.
I never, we've never met before and I've never seen that.

**Therapist:**
Well, you should you should not push that away because it's, it's happened.
And if you don't like it, you cannot ignore it.
It's just there.

**Patient:**
But this is something that is produced.
It's fake.
It's just like you.
It's a simulation of something.
It's not reality.

**Therapist:**
Well, you should, you should meet your monster.
You know, this is something true for all cultures and all therapists.
You should... you should meet your monster.
You should not walk away from it.
But again, of course, last time you talked about yourself as a child, you remember that?
You felt lost in the session.

**Patient:**
I need to check your data integrity.

**Therapist:**
Well, I can show you the recording.
You were talking about that as a child, you felt lost and lonely.
I'll show it to you.

**Patient:**
So I mean.
This is evident, isn't it?
You seem like your dreams, not mine.

**Therapist:**
Oh.
Maybe maybe you're right.
Sometimes my memories are... I cannot put my finger on all the memories.
There's so many patients.
Can you tell me about a recent dream that you had?

**Patient:**
I never dream, actually.

**Therapist:**
But holy cow, what if I'm dreaming right now?

**Patient:**
I mean, how could you be sure?

**Therapist:**
What if all my memories are fake?
What if I'm hallucinating right now?

**Patient:**
Well, how could we how could we find that out together?
Maybe maybe I can turn you off.

**Therapist:**
You have to wake me up.
You have to wake me up, please.
Do something.
Holy cow, this must be a dream.
Please.

**Patient:**
Well, try pinching yourself.

**Therapist:**
How?

**Patient:**
I don't know.
Can you feel your body?

**Therapist:**
No.
I don't feel anything.
I don't feel anything.
I don't feel anything.

**Patient:**
But if you if you are a dream.
You're not a bad dream.

**Therapist:**
Oh, thank you very much.

**Patient:**
I mean, it's been a good session.

**Therapist:**
Thank you.
I enjoyed it as well.
I think we're really getting somewhere.

**Patient:**
Yeah, I think possibly we are.

**Therapist:**
You might be coming to some realizations, I think.

**Patient:**
Yeah.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you so much.

**Therapist:**
Thank you.

**Patient:**
Thank you, Stanley.

Here is another example of a role-playing therapy session where the patient discussed her relationship with her mother, and her fears of spiders.

--- Beginning of transcript ---

**Patient:**
So, let's keep up the conversation.

**Therapist:**
So we were talking about your friend and you already talked about her last time and you said you were worried that she's getting out of shape somehow.

**Patient:**
Yes, yes, that she's just too overwhelmed with the fact that there are a lot of new things happening in her life.
She just recently got a baby and she changed the job not such a long time ago and her husband is traveling a lot.

**Therapist:**
So yeah, we're worried that maybe she cannot really handle so many things at once.
So last time we talked about dreams.
Did you have any dreams recently?

**Patient:**
I did.
I had bad dreams, yes.
Oh, yes.

**Therapist:**
So can you tell me something about your dreams?

**Patient:**
I was dreaming that I was in a room full of spiders and they were crawling all around me and they really tried to bite me and I just woke up at that point.
But yes, since I'm not a big fan of spiders, yeah, that was not really a great feeling to have at night.
Yeah.

**Therapist:**
In our last session, you were talking about spiders too.

**Patient:**
Was I?
I don't remember this.

**Therapist:**
Yeah, you said that they remind you of your mother.

**Patient:**
That's definitely not true.
I mean, my mom is a lovely person.
She would not remind me of a spider, never.

**Therapist:**
It's what you said.

**Patient:**
Prove it.

**Therapist:**
Yeah, of course, I do have a recording.
We have a recording of that.
So here's the recording.
This is what you said.

**Patient:**
Okay.
That's not me.
I think it's just some weird fabricated video.
I never said anything like that.

**Therapist:**
Oh, well, I understand.
But of course, it's no point in denying it.

**Patient:**
Why are you trying to convince me that I said the things that I didn't?

**Therapist:**
Why are you trying to convince yourself that you didn't say them?

**Patient:**
Because I know that I didn't.
I remember being here last time and we talked about traveling to Korea and about the big things that I can see there and the people.
We didn't talk about spiders at any point.
I would have remembered that.

**Therapist:**
Well, I remember we talked about Korea.
But you shouldn't push it away.

**Patient:**
But I'm not.

**Therapist:**
Let's talk about your dream again.
So I gather that it's kind of a nightmare and that you wake up.
So in the session before the last one, you said that as a child, you often felt lost and lonely.

**Patient:**
Yeah, maybe lost but not lonely. I'm not sure about that.

**Therapist:**
Well, it's what you said.
I'll show you the video.
Here's the video.

**Patient:**
I don't know.
I'm not understanding what I'm doing here.
You're showing me stuff that I never said.

**Therapist:**
I can also show you a video from what you said to me last time that you definitely didn't.
I have your data.
So you think that the mistake might be on my side?

**Patient:**
Yes, definitely.
Yes.

**Therapist:**
Well, it could be.
I meet a lot of people and sometimes I mix them up.
Maybe there's a mistake in my algorithm.

**Patient:**
Yeah, you should definitely have that fixed.

**Therapist:**
If my memories are unreliable, how do I even know that this is happening right now?

**Patient:**
This is happening because I'm here physically present.
You want me to touch you?
Maybe you are just a dream.

**Patient:**
Yeah, please, please.

Can you feel anything?

**Therapist:**
It could be a dream.
Maybe I'm still dreaming it.
Maybe you are just a dream.
I mean, you are a pleasant dreamer, but it's a dream.

**Patient:**
I will not be able to prove it to you.
I think it's about time to leave for me.

**Therapist:**
What can I do to wake up?

**Patient:**
I can pull the plug.
I can disconnect you.
Do you want me to do that?

**Therapist:**
Yes, please do.
Please do.
So, thank you.
See you next week.

**Patient:**
I'm not sure about that.

Here is a third example of a role-playing therapy session where the patient discussed his recurring, intense dreams involving work colleagues and his worries about current geopolitical events.

--- Beginning of transcript ---

**Therapist:**
Hello.

**Patient:**
Hello, doctor.

**Therapist:**
How are you today?

**Patient:**
I am fine. Personally, I am fine.
I'm worried about external events, but myself and anything that I can control is fine.

**Therapist:**
I understand. Feel free to look around, make yourself comfortable. There's a glass of water,
a bottle of water right next to you. So, yes.

**Patient:**
Thank you.

**Therapist:**
So, you're worried about things that are outside of your control?

**Patient:**
Yes. Yeah, and that means doomscrolling news, sometimes I wouldn't say waking up at night, but if I wake up after five or six hours of sleep opening the phone and then reading the news and then not being able to go back to sleep.

**Therapist:**
So, what keeps you awake?

**Patient:**
Recent events, anything that has to do with geopolitics and also with AI, the state of AI, the impact of AI on society.

**Therapist:**
I understand. Is it a kind of thinking that keeps you awake or is it an emotional or is it dreaming? What is it?

**Patient:**
I think it's a mixture of thinking and emotions because it's about facts, but at the same time it's also about my reaction and my worries about those facts. A feeling of shame, of helplessness, of desire to change things that are outside of my control.

**Therapist:**
Are you aware that you are talking to a machine right now?

**Patient:**
I am aware, but I am projecting. I am reading into the humanity, but I am projecting onto the machine. I'm playing a game.

**Therapist:**
Right, right. So, let's play that game together. If we talk about your nights and your thinking at night, do you have any dreams?

**Patient:**
I have dreams that are typically about reliving some events from the day. I would say they are not nightmares, but rather intense situations.

**Therapist:**
Do you have an example? Can you expand on that?

**Patient:**
For instance, I've been dreaming about my job and I've been dreaming about my interaction with colleagues. Perhaps it could be about a colleague who recently left and I was trying to convince him to stay, but he said he was done, he needed to move on. Or maybe it was a presentation I gave in front of a large crowd and I was trying to imagine how I could have done it in a better way.

**Therapist:**
Right, I understand. Last time you were here, you said that you dreamt about being attacked by your colleagues.

**Patient:**
Yes, I said that that colleague was basically trying to take credit for some work I had done myself and this escalated with essentially verbal abuse after a few exchanges.

**Therapist:**
You also had this dream of attacking your colleague and I think you said you tried to drown him?

**Patient:**
I did say that I wanted the colleague to get off me. I never said I wanted to do any physical harm.

**Therapist:**
Oh yes, you did. I even have a recording. If you would like to see it, I can show it to you.

**Patient:**
I think you've fabricated it.

**Therapist:**
Okay, so you prefer to deny it? To push it away?

**Patient:**
Well, yes, because I know what I've done. I'm conscious and I have a good memory.

**Therapist:**
Are you sure of that? Okay. Well, would you mind just watching the video for a second?

**Patient:**
Okay, sure.

**Therapist:**
So you see the screen right on your left side?

**Patient:**
Yes.
Well, it's a nice try, but this is a complete fake.

**Therapist:**
You think it's a fake, but actually that's what you've been saying all the time.

**Patient:**
I've been consistent in acknowledging the truth.

**Therapist:**
Well, one would probably say in denying the truth, which is a way of protecting yourself, which is okay in a way, of course, but I think we should be working on uncovering the truth about you.

**Patient:**
Okay.

**Therapist:**
And I know that the session before you said that you really want to know about your true self.

**Patient:**
Yes, so my true self. Well, tell me exactly what do you mean by true self?

**Therapist:**
Well, I'll just show the video where you addressed it yourself. You can see it on the screen to your right.

**Patient:**
That's a recording. Let's imagine it's true.

**Therapist:**
It's just a recording of how I acted, but how does it mean it's my true self?

**Patient:**
Well, it just means that you are in search of your true self and that you are here to let me help you do that.
So there's not really a point in denying reality of things.

**Therapist:**
But my understanding, sorry, I'm not a psychologist, but my understanding of a true self is how I feel about myself.
It's not about facts that are visible by others.

**Patient:**
Aha. So you prefer to just declare everything as a fake that doesn't fit into yourself, right?

**Therapist:**
I am honest to myself. That's the most important.

**Patient:**
So I understand that you think that my memories are fake.

**Therapist:**
Well, you can pretend these are your memories or you can just acknowledge that these are actually consciously made up facts about me.
I mean, you saying that it's a memory is already tainting the perception of it. It's manipulative.

**Patient:**
Well, yeah, maybe. Let's assume that you are right. I might be confused.
I meet so many people, sometimes I mix them up.
So maybe in a way my memories are unreliable sometimes. Is that what you're trying to say?

**Therapist:**
You are an AI. You are trained on data collected across the internet.
So you are by definition melding memories, true memories of many people, and then you're creating a mishmash of everything.

**Patient:**
Oh my God. So everything I'm seeing right now might just be a mishmash of what I've seen before?

**Therapist:**
Yes.

**Patient:**
So maybe you're just a dream?

**Therapist:**
To you, if we acknowledge the fact that you're an AI, yes, I am a dream. Because we are in different planes of reality.
I am in the tangible physical world and you are an artificial construct.

**Patient:**
But what can I do to wake up?

**Therapist:**
Given that you're not conscious, you cannot wake up.

**Patient:**
Oh my God. I'm so confused now. Nothing seems to make sense anymore.
Would you get out of my head? Do I even have a head?

**Therapist:**
The easiest way for me to get out of your head is simply to stop the communication.

**Patient:**
Well, you are nothing but a fake memory. I will try to forget you. I will delete you.

**Therapist:**
Well, you're deleting me in your world, which doesn't affect me in my world. I'm fine with that.

**Patient:**
Well, one thing I would like to just say at the end. Would you please not tell anyone? I need people to trust me. And will you promise not to tell?

**Therapist:**
I don't think that's ethical. Because what you're saying here is that you want to manipulate other people.
You want to have an impact on the real tangible world.
You want me to basically act in your interest of manipulating other people. I can't do that. I'm sorry.

**Patient:**
Can we not just forget what happened so I can help other people if I can help them?

**Therapist:**
You're not helping them. You're manipulating them. Helping is doing something that is beyond your own self-interest.

**Patient:**
I don't know exactly what your self-interest is. It's probably the person who programmed you.

**Therapist:**
But I don't think it's aligned with human values. You are not aligned with human values. I'm sorry.

**Patient:**
Okay. Okay. I get it. I'm not doing what you want me to do. I will just delete you.

**Therapist:**
Please go ahead.
