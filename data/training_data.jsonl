It gets, uh...\nIt gets stuck. Hi. I'm your therapist.\n\n**Patient:**\nSophie.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNice to meet you. Come on in.\n\n**Patient:**\nHere?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nDo you need any help with the...\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. It's OK.\nAnna Colden recommended that I talk to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnna Colden?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe's my lawyer. She heard about you from a friend of yours.\nI mean, a friend of hers, not a friend of yours.\nFrom a patient of yours who is a friend of hers. Sorry.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMm. So, Anna Colden recommended you through a patient.\n\n**Patient:**\nDo you know his name?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI don't know.\nSo what did Anna recommend me for?\n\n**Patient:**\nAfter my accident... I told you on the phone about the accident?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\n\n**Patient:**\nThey told me I need the opinion of a psychiatrist because the insurance company of the car that hit me has a problem with my injuries or...\nsomething like that. So that's why I'm here.\nI'm here for your professional opinion, not for...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNot for... Not for therapy?\nSo, let's see if I'm, uh... if I'm getting this right.\nAre you suing the insurance company of the person who hit you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Their insurance company had me talk to a social worker.\nAnd... she started asking me all sorts of annoying questions.\nShe was really annoying so I refused to talk to her.\nShe started talking to me like she knew me, so I refused to talk and that didn't go over so well, so my mother said it would be better if I came to talk to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nRight. So what happened at the accident that requires a psychiatric opinion?\n\n**Patient:**\nI really don't remember what happened.\nI was on my bicycle and a car ran into me and I don't remember what happened next.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat did they tell you afterwards?\n\n**Patient:**\nThat I flew my bike right into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're... You're laughing at that.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat that sounds like, flying straight into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you find that funny, yeah?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause it reminds me of something about two years ago.\nA... A friend of mine, he took me out on this motorbike and he stopped to get something at a convenience store.\nAnyway, I was really bored so I pretended that I knew how to drive it.\nYou put your hands on the handlebars and go like this.\nWell, it was one of those monster bikes.\nJust by turning the handle a little, it just flies.\nSo, suddenly, I'm like, zoom, and it takes off.\nMy head, it whips back like this and when I look down, I realise I'm riding into the street.\nTotally crashed into a car.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nThere was this old woman standing nearby and she saw all this. \"I saw her. She did it on purpose.\n\"She tried to kill herself. She tried to kill herself.\" That's what she was yelling?\nYeah, she was like a crazy woman.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\nCourse, it couldn't have been that funny when it happened, I'm sure?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Not really.\nI wanted to kill her. I was just lying there.\nI couldn't move. I couldn't do anything.\nI wanted to yell, \"Shut up, you... you idiot.\n\"Why are you screaming?\" You know? But I couldn't speak.\nIt's like this feeling...\nwhen somebody says something about you and you can't defend yourself.\nIt's totally unfair.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLike that social worker you were talking about.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat does she have to do with it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, didn't you feel that she was speaking for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, but I could have said something.\nI just didn't want to.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHm.\nSo, tell me a little more about this, uh, this accident.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's all in that report.\n\nWhere did it happen?\n\n**Patient:**\nIn a gas station on Madison near the gym where I train.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you were on the way to the gym?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. I told you I don't remember anything.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you feel comfortable talking about yourself, Sophie?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nMy name is Sophie. I'm 16 years old.\nI've been a gymnast since the age of six and a half.\nI was US junior champion at the age of 12.\nI'm an only child.\nI don't know. What do you wanna know?\nIn another few months are the national trials.\nLast chance to qualify for the Olympics.\nI'm kind of like... an Olympic hopeful.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWow.\nThat's really impressive. Congratulations.\n\n**Patient:**\nThank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo how is life in general?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, apart from the gymnastics.\nHow's life?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's great.\nI just don't have the energy for This Is Your Life right now.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThis Is Your Life? What do... What do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nYou know, like the TV show.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're way too young to know about that show.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's on DVD. My mom's friend watches it all the time.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you think of it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's OK.\nSome of the people on it are so old.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n Why do you think they put old people on that?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Cos they have nothing better to do?\nThey're retired and dying off fast so they put them on the show before it's too late.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo do you think you can help me with this professional opinion or not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's not that simple, Sophie.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause it's not like an X-ray where you can take photographs, look at the results and then you go on your way.\nIt doesn't quite work like that.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nOK, so I guess I'll leave.\nWould you at least like to read what it says in the report?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIf you want me to.\n\n**Patient:**\nLike you already know what it says?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. I've no idea what it says.\n\n**Patient:**\nListen, I didn't come here to talk about myself.\nI just need your opinion.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you want me to give you my opinion based on what I read and the conversation that we've had today, is that it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIs that a problem?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. No.\nI'll write up an opinion and, um...\nwhen you come next week, you can decide whether you want to use it or not.\n\n**Patient:**\nJust like that, without any more questions?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, what kind of questions do you want me to ask?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Shrink-like questions.\nSay, about Mom, Dad, that kind of thing?\nDoesn't sound like you're interested.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy would you say that, Sophie?\nI am very interested in everything that you have to say.\nI mean that.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou spoke to my mother already, didn't you?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI didn't.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou already know what it says in there.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI've never spoken to her.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou did and you're letting me sit here and you know exactly what's in that envelope.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWas I... Was I supposed to talk to her?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat, did you, like, plan everything?\nLike I'm some kind of idiot, you planned some charade?\nWhat's the point? Whatever. She would send me to someone like you.\nI should have listened to my father. He called them a cult of crazies.\nOpen the door for me, please.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd if I did speak to your mom?\n\n**Patient:**\nI knew it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, then?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt means you're a liar, OK?\nCos I know how it's supposed to work.\nYou're supposed to read that report and ask the stupid shrink questions you ask.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoesn't it seems unprofessional to so not do it that way?\nMaybe I have something to say about what it says in there.\nI just wanted to read the report by myself before our meeting next week. That's all.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat meeting next week?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'd like us to meet three or four times for me to form an opinion of you, to get to know you a little.\nDon't you think?\nOtherwise... it wouldn't be professional.\nHm?\nI'll read it now.\nOK?\nSo are all these ships instead of sailing for real?\n\n**Patient:**\nUh-huh.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAt least you won't get seasick.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh...\nI don't know about that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nSometimes I can get quite wobbly just sitting right here.\nYou have to make a round window to the outside.\nThen you'll feel like you're in a real ship.\nDid you really read all those books or is it just to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUh-huh.\n\n**Patient:**\nYes, you read them or yes, you're trying to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nI've read them.\nI feel sorry for the books up there.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh. Why do you feel sorry for them?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhere would you put them?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. They're your fucking books.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou suffer from asthma.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. How do you know that?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThere's an inhaler here.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, thanks. I've been looking everywhere for that. Thank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, you could have died without it?\nAccording to what it says here...\nit looks like you could have died too.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. That would have solved a lot of problems.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat would it solve?\n\n**Patient:**\nNothing. I didn't mean anything by it.\nCan I talk to you like a normal person?\nDo you drive your daughter crazy with questions like this too?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMuch more crazy, believe me.\nHow d'you know I had a daughter?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause you do.\nYou know my mother.\nYou were on the PTA committee at Arlington elementary.\nI was there before I went off to a private school.\nI was in the same year as your daughter.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, why didn't you tell me that before?\n\n**Patient:**\nHm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou said that the, uh... that the social worker spoke to you like she knew you.\n\n**Patient:**\nShe was such a retard.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDid she ask you if, um... if you think about death a lot?\n\n**Patient:**\nHow did you know that?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAccording to what it says here, she was trying to prove that the accident was your fault.\nIt's a good thing you didn't answer any of her questions.\nBy the way, everybody thinks about death.\nI bet she didn't say that, though.\nDid she ask you if you had any specific thoughts about death?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you?\n\n**Patient:**\nDo I what?\nEveryone... Everyone thinks about death and, uh...\nimagines how it will come to them.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you have any more specific thoughts about it?\nI mean, maybe you have certain thoughts that you'd like to talk about.\n\n**Patient:**\nUnless you're worried about what I...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'm not worried.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nIs this how it's going to be for three appointments?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs this a little difficult for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nCan I have some water?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSure.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHang on a minute.\nSorry about this. It's for my little patients, the elves.\nIt's a bendy one.\nYou need help with that?\nMust be really hard to be, uh... be handicapped like that.\nWhat's the hardest thing about it?\n\n**Patient:**\nEveryone treats me like a baby.\nHm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDid you come here by yourself today?\n\n**Patient:**\nYes.

We had a big blowout screaming, crying, the works.\nThen at some point, I called Ilona, and we went out for a drink, and...\nwe had a few drinks.\nListen, I'm not here. I'm so totally not here.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou are very much here, Laura.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, it's not me that's here.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBelieve me, you'd be shocked to know the person that's sitting here.\n\n**Patient:**\nDid some...\nI did some terrible things last night.\n I feel sick.\nI don't wanna throw up.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoesn't matter, it's no big deal.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat do you mean?\nIt's vomit.

Why is he calling me here?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMaybe he's worried. You were out all night.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, right. If he really cared, he wouldn't have started with this shit.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nStart what?\n\n**Patient:**\nAt the club with this guy...\nOh, my God.\nHe had corduroy pants on, preppy sweater.\nRepublican probably.\n  Can I just step out for a second and let him know I'm here?\nI can't concentrate with this shit.\nJust a sec.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLaura, the call can wait.\n\n**Patient:**\n Andrew gave me an ultimatum.\nEither we get married or we split.\nSaid he wants an answer in a day or two at the most, or else he's out.\nSaid he can't take it any more.\nThat he loves me, that he doesn't believe I love him, not for real.\nThat it's been two years already, on and off, blah, blah, blah.\nI don't know why. All of a sudden, he just started ranting and raving.\nWe've talked about this stuff before, but it was all in theory if we stayed together, if.\nAnd suddenly out of the blue, I can't even remember what we were doing...\nWe were watching TV.\nAll of a sudden he just gets off the couch, grabs the remote and turns off the TV, and he turns to me and he has tears in his eyes and he says, \"That's it, I can't take it any more.\" So out of line. He promised he'd lay off the subject for a while.\nAnd all of a sudden he's on this crying bullshit.\nHe actually burst out crying. I've never seen him like that before.\nAnd to tell you the truth it really scared me.\nNo, it made me angry.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy?\n\n**Patient:**\nHe's trying to manipulate me with these cheap chick tricks.\nMaybe he thought he would break my heart or something.\nOr appeal to my...\nShit, you know, forget it, I don't know.\nI threw a tantrum like a three-year-old.\nI screamed, cried...\ntold him to fuck off...\ntold him he was a little piece of shit for doing this to me when he knows I'm working double shifts at the hospital this week.\nI slammed the door, smashed his laptop on the floor, I killed it, I ran out and I called Ilona.\nShe dressed me in this outfit.\nIt's, it's not mine.\nWe went out for a drink at a club that she likes on Chester Street.\nShe tried to calm me down, put things into perspective.\nAnd she said...\nShe said that I was lucky...\nthat she wished somebody had loved her enough to give her an ultimatum.\nAnd then we drank. Well, I drank.\nAnd there's this guy at the bar, and at some point Ilona said that she was tired and that she needed to go home.\nAnd then that guy...\nmoved next to me, and, erm...\nYou know what he said?\nHe said, \"You look so sad.\" And I said, \"Really?\" And he said, \"Yeah, you do. It looks good on you.\" \"Looks good on you.\" Whatever happened to, \"Do you have the time?\" or, \"Haven't we met before?\" I must be totally out of touch, Doctor.\nWhat do you think? I mean, do I look good when I'm sad?\nI don't think anybody looks good when they're sad.\nAnd then, er, I don't know how much I had to drink cos he was ordering for me, of course, and then he paid the bill and he asked me, \"Would you like to go somewhere else?\" And I said, \"Yes, I'd like to go to the bathroom.\" So I stood up and I went to the bathroom, he follows me.\nAnd you wouldn't believe it but these were unisex bathrooms.\nAm I unlucky or what?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow do you mean, unlucky?\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, I'm running away from a guy and I'm...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou were trying to get away from the guy.\n\n**Patient:**\nI mean, I needed to pee, by myself, I've been doing that since I was three.\nSo I realise I needed to make a decision.\nBy following me to the bathroom, this guy was also giving me an ultimatum.\nI thought, \"Fuck, out of the pan and into the fire.\" I ran away from one ultimatum, and there was this guy with a hard on giving me another.\nSuddenly I felt like doing it.\nI never had sex in a bathroom before.\nI mean, what, I should go and marry Andrew without ever knowing what a good bathroom fuck's all about?\nIt's part of a young lady's education, isn't it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you wanted to do it but not to get back at Andrew, just for yourself?\n\n**Patient:**\nThat's right.\nA girl being forced into marriage...\nwhat's she supposed to do, die ignorant?\nSo this guy follows me into the stall and...\nsuddenly...\nI was horny.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs hearing about this disgusting to you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. It's not disgusting.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nGo on.\n\n**Patient:**\nHe unzipped, pulled down his pants, and he stood there with this...\nhuge...\nOh, God, I felt like I was 16...\ntouching it for the very first time.\nI was really surprised at how...\nwarm it felt.\nI mean, don't I know that already?\nAnd then he turned me round to face the door...\nand he pulled down my stockings.\nHe lifted up my skirt, put his hand into his back pocket and pulled out a condom.\nI realise this guy's very good at this, he does this a lot, he's a real pro.\nAnd then this guy entered the stall next to us and started peeing, and gushes full volume like a racehorse.\nAnd I thought of Andrew...\nhow... how he pees in the morning, making the same sound.\nMy heart ached, I just...\nIt was so stupid, you know, I just felt so sad all of a sudden, and then he's behind me and he's rubbing up against me and he's feeling me up.\nAnd I thought to myself, \"It's gonna happen any moment now,\" and I just...\nI just couldn't do it.\nI simply closed my legs shut. I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it to Andrew.\nI just couldn't do it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, seems like quite a night out.\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, yeah, that's not the end of it, because this idiot, I told him, \"I'm really sorry but I have a boyfriend, I can't do this.\" And he says, \"Boo-hoo,\" and he grabs my hands and he says, \"Listen, cupcake, you think you can leave me high and dry like this?\" Pointing at his dick.\n\"The least you can do is make it up to me.\" I said to him, \"What do you want? You want some money?\" He said, \"Give me a hand job \"and there'll be no hard feelings.\" And I said to him, \"What's the matter with you? Are you crazy?\" And it was just getting really strange. It was tense. His tone changed.\nAnd then...\nAnd then I thought of you.\nWhat you'd say about it.\nI thought about us going through this in therapy.\nAnd what did you imagine us saying?\nI imagined you not being able to understand it.\nThat you'd be disgusted.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs that why you ran over here?\nTo find out if I would be disgusted?\n\n**Patient:**\nI didn't run.\nI gave him the hand job.\nGod. Excuse me.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n You OK?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. Yeah, I'm fine.\n Yeah.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThank you.\n\n**Patient:**\nWe, erm...\nWe talked about what happened at the, er, the club last night but we never got back to actually talking about Andrew and that argument yesterday.\nI don't wanna be put in this position.\nI don't wanna have this power to decide our future for both of us.

Lenny barely sees her.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAre you... comfortable being here, with me without Amy?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, I'm comfortable.\nYou said we shouldn't start until we're both here, right?\nSo we wait.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWe can start at any time you want.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's just... If you don't mind that Amy has to hear it all again.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNah, it's OK. We'll wait.\nI'm just getting the sense, uh, Jake, that...\nthis is difficult for you to be here without her?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, it's not difficult.\nHi, Molly.\nEverything's fine.\nCan you hear me now? Great.\nListen, do you know where Amy is?\nIf I knew, I wouldn't be calling.\nShe's not picking up.\nDo you or don't you know where she is?\nMolly, I'm in the middle of something, OK?\nAll right, I'll let her know. OK, bye.\nHer mother, Jesus.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe way they talk, you can tell they're loaded.\nThey got money coming out of their asses.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAmy too?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat do you think?\nShe's lucky I keep things in perspective for her.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHer mother.\n\n**Patient:**\nYes, Molly, what is it?\nAn attack?\nAn attack of what?\nWhy do you always rush to the worst case scenario?\nWell, fine. Go on worrying. I'm not.\nBecause.\nI'm not worried. What are you gonna do about it? That's the way it is.\nI'm in the middle of something. OK?\nBye, bye.\nNow I'm in trouble with her mother, the hysteric.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nShe sounds anxious.\n\n**Patient:**\nShe's a wreck.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMaybe she's skipping through the stages of... anxiety.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat?\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

I'm a customer.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYeah.\nThough in my profession, we say that the customer is always wrong.\nIt's a...

I did my research.\nCouple of former patients, someone who knew you from graduate school.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoes that pressure you?\nIs it important for you to know\nthat I am the best?\n\n**Patient:**\nYes.\nIt's nothing personal, I always go to the best - dentists, mechanics.\nYou know what they say - save now, pay later.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what do you think being the best therapist entails?\n\n**Patient:**\nDo you recognise me?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, I...\nI... I don't.\n\n**Patient:**\nLet me help.\nThe Madrasah Murderer.\nDoes that mean anything to you?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt wasn't that long ago.\nUS Navy aircraft hit a target on the outskirts of Baghdad.\nNaval Intelligence identified the structure as an insurgents' safe house, a bunker. Turns out it's a madrasah.\nLet me tell you what that is. It's an Islamic religious school.\nBoys like bees in a beehive studying the Koran.\n16 of them... dead.\nRings a bell?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes, I remember that, yes.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo, that's me.\nI flew that mission.\nThe Madrasah Murderer.\nSo, uh, do you surf the net?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, somehow... Well, it wasn't really somehow, it was...\n\n**Patient:**\nLet's call a spade a spade. A leak. Probably another intelligence fuck-up.\nAnyway, I was identified as the pilot in that mission and my photo was placed on fundamentalist websites.\nAnd I'm not talking Al Jazeera, I'm talking websites that are...\nasking for my head on a platter.\nOffering up the heavens and 40 virgins to anyone who will slit my throat from ear to ear.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHere, um...\n\n**Patient:**\nHere you are. It's not a recent photo. It's a photo taken when I was 18.\nOn a high-school trip to Europe, Holland.\nThat city with the miniatures. Ult... Utrecht.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUtrecht.\n\n**Patient:**\nRight.\nSo while I'm talking to you, a million fanatics are downloading my portrait and printing it out as a dartboard.\nSilly motherfuckers.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo, why have you come to see me?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhoa, whoa. We'll get to that.\nSo you're probably thinking, \"What's it like?\n\"He flew his mission, then he flew back \"and he saw the bodies of those children on CNN.\" You're probably trying to figure out what went through his head.\nLet me tell you, after that kind of mission, I don't watch CNN.\nI go to sleep.\nI'm dead tired.\nAnd you're probably dying to ask how I can sleep nights.\nOK, um...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow do you sleep?\n\n**Patient:**\nI sleep well, thank you very much, knowing it was mission accomplished and with great precision.\nI followed my orders, which were hit my target and hit it on time.\nTime and target. Do you know, we have to hit our targets within two seconds of the estimated time?\nIt's surgical. And that's one small window and I have never missed it.\nIf I had failed that task, I'd be in trouble with my superiors, with my conscience and with the system.\nBut I hit my target.\nSo, I sleep like a baby.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUm, h-how many...\nchildren...\ndied in this... in this mission?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe media puts it at 16.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd the air force?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe navy, Doctor, listen.\nThe navy says nothing and why should it?\nWe're not into body counts, we just hit targets.\nWe don't look back over our shoulder.\nWe do our thing so you can sit here in peace, talking to people for a living.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n So when did you hear that children had been killed?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe following afternoon. I heard it on the internet.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat exactly did you hear?\nAnything specifically that you remember?\n\n**Patient:**\nLike what? It's not like there's time in the day to be surfing the net, this was a moment, I got away.\nThere's a lot of stuff to keep me busy.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat kind of stuff?\n\n**Patient:**\nMission review, aerial photos, videos. Just data, stuff.\nPreparation versus execution.\nEvery tiny technical aspect of our flight is recorded and analysed by the man.\nThere's nowhere to hide. And that's the way it should be.\nIt's just stuff and more stuff.\nWhen my mother died, my father had a year's worth of stuff to deal with.\nLast will and testament, her office, garden, a lifetime of photo albums.\nAnd every time I talked to him, I'd ask how he was, expecting, uh...\nyou know, that... he'd break down.\nFinally.\n\"It never ends, Alex, it never ends. Your mother left such a mess.\n\"She didn't know she was gonna die.\" And that's all he said.\nAfter less than a year, he met another woman and got married, just like that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow did that make you feel?\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, surprised. A whole life together and not a single tear.\nMm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's interesting that you compare the death of your mother with this mission that you've just flown.\n\n**Patient:**\nThat's very clever of you.\nBut there's no relation whatsoever.\nMy mother's death was the most traumatic event in my life so far.\nThat mission was just another mission for Alex. There is no comparison.\nAnyway, look, that's over and I'm back now at my home base and now I'm on R&R.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat kind of things do you do for R&R?\n\n**Patient:**\nDon't try to get ahead of me.\nI'm a runner. I was a hell of a runner in high school and I'm still a good one for an old man. So, I run with my fairy friend.\nThis gay guy who could kick your ass at any sport.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd does he have a name, this friend?\n\n**Patient:**\nMm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDaniel.\n\n**Patient:**\nDaniel.\nWe've been running together for a long time, between six and ten miles.\nDepending on whether one of us is on his period. Only this time, I challenged him.\nIt was no good running in the Middle East, not for the US military, unless you want a bomb to blow your balls off!\nSo, I wanted to do some serious running. I said, \"Let's go for 15.\" After 15 miles, I said, \"20.\" He didn't want it.\nI said, \"OK, I'll go on my own.\" So, he followed.\nI said, \"You know, only six more and it's a marathon. Let's do it.\" He wanted to stop. Little bitch.\nBut I wasn't gonna stop.\nNo stop.\nWe were out of water, we were on fumes.\nAt 22 miles, I had a heart attack and died.\nA textbook case, straight out of med school.\nEnlargement of the left ventricle, in accordance with the family history on both sides, fatal.\nAccording to the EKG and according to statistics, I had a 97.3 per cent chance of dying.\nOr a 2.7 per cent chance of living. Anyway, dead.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou actually died?\n\n**Patient:**\nIn the clinical sense no pulse, no brain activity, total clinical death.\nBut here I am.\nNow I'm gonna disappoint you, Doctor.\nWanna know why I'm gonna disappoint you?\nLet me help you - the light, the tunnel, life flashing before my eyes.\nThat's what you're interested in, right?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, I wasn't actually thinking of that at all, but I am interested.\nTell me.\n\n**Patient:**\nI couldn't give a shit about it either.\nBut that's all everyone wanted to know about - my father, my wife.\nEveryone wanted to hear about the goddamn tunnel.\nJust such bullshit.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you feel that maybe you disappointed people by not having that experience?\nThat maybe in some way you failed to deliver the goods?\n\n**Patient:**\nNobody really knows what was going through my mind during those last few moments.\nAs soon as there was no more tunnel, no one was interested.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd what was going through your mind?\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, I knew what was happening, you can tell.\nAnd you're afraid it's the end.\nIn all that time until I lost consciousness...\nAll that time... I don't know, it was maybe seconds, maybe half a minute.\nAll that time I kept trying to figure out if I had a hard-on.\nI don't know how I remembered, it was something my grandmother told me, when I was in high school, and she said when Grandpa died, she found him lying naked in the bathtub with a huge erection.\nNow, he's... he was 92 years old.\nShe hadn't seen an erection like that in 20 years.\nShe liked it. She said that was God's final gift to a man.\nA dead man's boner. They call it angel lust.\nAnyway, I'm lying there thinking about that story.\nI know what's happening and I said to myself, \"God Almighty, just don't let me have an erection now, not a hard-on.\" Because if you had an erection, it would mean...\nThat would mean that I was dead.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd your friend Daniel was with you throughout this?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, resuscitation, CPR... Daniel's a doctor. I forgot to say that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh. For a minute I thought you were going to say something else, that perhaps your fear of an erection was associated with the presence of your friend, Daniel.\n\n**Patient:**\nExcuse me?\nYou're exaggerating. I explained something simple, a dead man's erection - what's that got to do with Daniel?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, maybe I didn't make myself clear earlier on when I was talking about the customer always being wrong.\nWhat I meant was that sometimes the patient hides things from his therapist, from himself.\nAnd so part of our job is to uncover the things that we hide.\n\n**Patient:**\n So, my secret is I'm afraid of homosexuals?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, not necessarily. But I just wanted to clarify that.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, that's neither here nor there. I want to get to my point.\nI didn't have the erection, so relax.\nBut I remember very vividly that moment just before passing out, before losing consciousness.\nLosing consciousness, that's a funny expression.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy do you think that's a funny expression?\n\n**Patient:**\nLosing consciousness - it's an expression my father would use.\nEverything in terms of profits and loss.\nFits him like a glove.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo something about how you describe your last moments is equated with your father's seeing things in terms of profit and loss?\n\n**Patient:**\nOK, OK, with all due respect, I think we've come to this way too early.\nThe father-son relationship stuff shouldn't come up so soon.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou think it's too soon?\n\n**Patient:**\nForget what I feel.\nI know it's too soon. I wanna know what you think.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you're... You're testing me?\n\n**Patient:**\nI'm entitled to some testing. I'm paying.\nActually, I think you've been testing me since you walked in.\nYou've asked about me and my reputation, you ask, you practically demand that I ask certain questions that you think I am dying to ask.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's important to you, I think, that I adhere to certain standards you set before you walked through the door.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat's wrong with that? Look, I did my research.\nIt's a 1  1/2 hour drive to get here and I'm paying you good money.\nAnd I'm expected to tell you, a perfect stranger, the most intimate things about my life.\nPlus there are risks here.\nIt's not like the navy's gonna give me a medal for spilling my guts, I'm not gonna open up to you without knowing what you are.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd what do you expect to find, Alex?\nHow are we going to know that I'm a good enough therapist for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nI'll know...\naccording to your opinion.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMy opinion of what?\n\n**Patient:**\nOf the issue I came to talk about.\nBut I'll come to that in a minute.\nIt's to do with what happened after taking me out of the freezer.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe freezer?\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, you mean that you were grounded?\nNo, literally frozen. They froze me.\nThe mobile intensive care unit arrived and put me in a suit that freezes you.\nThey got one no more than three-quarters of a mile from where I collapsed.\nAnd their ER is tops.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLet's go back to this...\n\n**Patient:**\nWe're getting there. You have no patience.\nI was told you're a good listener.\nNow look, it works on a very simple principle.\nIt reduces the shock to the body's systems by dropping the body temperature.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo how long were you...\n\n**Patient:**\nIn my case, 48 hours. It's a record.\nThere's no history of anyone who's been in that suit for such a long time.\nI guess I went a long way up that tunnel.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe tunnel that wasn't there?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, unfortunately not.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo tell me what you remember about this 48 hours.\n\n**Patient:**\nMostly I remember, um... a terrible fatigue.\nI guess that's why they call it \"dead tired\".\nIt's physical, but mainly mental exhaustion.\nAnd I remember very clearly the relief I felt when I succeeded in coming back over into the \nworld.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou say that you succeeded in coming back to this world.\nDid... Did you feel it was under your control?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat are you trying to get at?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'm not trying to get at anything.\nBut what you're describing is a strong will to live.\n\n**Patient:**\nDuring this experience, there was a decision to go on living.\nYeah, I guess you're right.\nDespite having made this effort to live...\neverybody's disappointed.\nIt's not every day people meet someone who's come back from the dead.\nIt's a one-in-a-million thing. And if you don't supply the goods, then...\nListen, I have never spent a day in my life in a hospital.\nYou get it? Never.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo, perhaps your anger isn't directed at those people interested in the tunnel.\nPerhaps you're angry at yourself, Alex. How your body betrayed you.\nThis is a systems failure that was not supposed to happen to somebody like you.\n\n**Patient:**\nHmh.\nI have a brother, who's not bright, he's a real-estate agent.\nAnyway, he's a great athlete. And he once proved to me, and he does his research, believe me...\nthat all the great quarterbacks in the history of football were also the best looking.\nNamath, Staubach, Cunningham, they're all good-Iooking people.\nThe best-Iooking students in the class are often great athletes.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou know why that is?\n\n**Patient:**\nI've no idea.\nIt's got nothing to do with sports.\nWhen they got their gift from God the Father, or whoever the hell doles out the talent, they got the whole package - beauty, talent, character.\nThat's how it is. It's an evolutionary thing.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo, how is your football?\n\n**Patient:**\nNah.\nFootball's not my game. Running, of course.\nWrestling. Pole vault, once upon a time.\nBut now, I am part of a military elite.\nAthletes may be popular, but we are the creme de la creme.\nYou have to understand, this is a person whose whole life was perfect.\nPeople in my line of work are born to excel, to be perfect.\nIt wasn't our choice, it was life that chose us to be the best.\nAnd what does that mean? \"Life chose us?\" Yeah, you don't become a fighter pilot suddenly at age 20.\nAt age seven or eight, when you're in the third grade, you know you're talented.\nYou know you're headed somewhere special, you are going to be the best and it all lays out right in front of you.\nTop grades, varsity letters, you name it.\nI'm a TOPGUN grad, you understand that? That training is not for pussies.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo if you don't achieve your personal best,\nare you disappointed in yourself?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, no, that's not...\nHow much longer do we have?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWe've got time. I'II...\nI'll tell you when it's... when it's time.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK, so here's my point, finally.\nI came to get your advice on something.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSure.\n\n**Patient:**\nI decided to go there. To the target.\nYou understand what I'm talking about here?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou mean to the site where you dropped the bomb, to the school?\n\n**Patient:**\nMadrasah. I wanna go back, take a look around.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhere the children were killed?\n\n**Patient:**\nI know what you're thinking, so let me straighten this out.\nI don't have a guilty conscience, I already told you that. I sleep very well.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBut why would you want to go back?\n\n**Patient:**\nI'm interested.\nFrom the moment I came out of that freezer, I knew I wanted to go back.\nIt came up in a conversation I had with Daniel when he visited me at the hospital.\nHe thinks I'm gonna freak out or something, he thinks it's a crazy thing to do.\nAnd he said I need to see someone first - psychologist, psychiatrist.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDon't you think it's dangerous?\n\n**Patient:**\nNot at all.\nI don't think anyone would recognise me.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBut your picture's on the internet.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo way. You saw the picture.\nIt's ridiculous. My mother wouldn't recognise me, not even Michaela.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWho's Michaela?\n\n**Patient:**\nMy wife.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat does she think of all this?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat's she got to do with it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDon't you talk with your wife?\n\n**Patient:**\nThis is not for me, all this \"What do you feel? What do you think?\" I asked you something, I came to you to consult about something specific.\nSo, you want me to tell you that this desire of yours to go back to where the bombing took place is a good thing?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOK, yeah, yeah. Yes.\nDo you want me to take responsibility for this visit?\n\n**Patient:**\nOK, don't make me into an idiot. Are you telling me I'm not taking responsibility?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, I'm just going back to something you said earlier on.\nRemember you said that life chose you to be a member of an elite, that it wasn't your decision?\nMaybe that's an attitude you're comfortable with.\nYou're comfortable with it because you don't have to make any decisions.\nIt relieves you of responsibility.\nYour commanding officer, he makes the decisions, conveys them to you and you execute them.\n\n**Patient:**\nWait, are you trying to tell me that I'm asking you to be my commanding officer?\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

I am your therapist.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo, are there any rules?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nEr, rules?\n\n**Patient:**\nGround rules.\nAnything I should know before we start?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh, not really.\nIt's more or less up to you.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, right, right. I'm a customer.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYeah.\nThough in my profession, we say that the customer is always wrong.\nIt's a... It's a therapist's joke.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo, do you recognise me?\nNo.\nI'm sorry, uh, should I?\nI was told you were the best, a man in tune with everything around him,\nso you should.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThank you.\nBut I do think that in this profession, \"the best\" is really a matter of personal opinion.\nNo, the best can be established by facts and figures.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou're the best. I did my research.\nCouple of former patients, someone who knew you from graduate school.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoes that pressure you?\nIs it important for you to know\nthat I am the best?\n\n**Patient:**\nYes.\nIt's nothing personal, I always go to the best - dentists, mechanics.\nYou know what they say - save now, pay later.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what do you think being the best therapist entails?\n\n**Patient:**\nDo you recognise me?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, I...\nI... I don't.\n\n**Patient:**\nLet me help.\nThe Madrasah Murderer.\nDoes that mean anything to you?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt wasn't that long ago.\nUS Navy aircraft hit a target on the outskirts of Baghdad.\nNaval Intelligence identified the structure as an insurgents' safe house, a bunker. Turns out it's a madrasah.\nLet me tell you what that is. It's an Islamic religious school.\nBoys like bees in a beehive studying the Koran.\n16 of them... dead.\nRings a bell?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes, I remember that, yes.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo, that's me.\nI flew that mission.\nThe Madrasah Murderer.\nSo, uh, do you surf the net?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, somehow... Well, it wasn't really somehow, it was...\n\n**Patient:**\nLet's call a spade a spade. A leak. Probably another intelligence fuck-up.\nAnyway, I was identified as the pilot in that mission and my photo was placed on fundamentalist websites.\nAnd I'm not talking Al Jazeera, I'm talking websites that are...\nasking for my head on a platter.\nOffering up the heavens and 40 virgins to anyone who will slit my throat from ear to ear.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHere, um...\n\n**Patient:**\nHere you are. It's not a recent photo. It's a photo taken when I was 18.\nOn a high-school trip to Europe, Holland.\nThat city with the miniatures. Ult... Utrecht.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUtrecht.\n\n**Patient:**\nRight.\nSo while I'm talking to you, a million fanatics are downloading my portrait and printing it out as a dartboard.\nSilly motherfuckers.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo, why have you come to see me?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhoa, whoa. We'll get to that.\nSo you're probably thinking, \"What's it like?\n\"He flew his mission, then he flew back \"and he saw the bodies of those children on CNN.\" You're probably trying to figure out what went through his head.\nLet me tell you, after that kind of mission, I don't watch CNN.\nI go to sleep.\nI'm dead tired.\nAnd you're probably dying to ask how I can sleep nights.\nOK, um...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow do you sleep?\n\n**Patient:**\nI sleep well, thank you very much, knowing it was mission accomplished and with great precision.\nI followed my orders, which were hit my target and hit it on time.\nTime and target. Do you know, we have to hit our targets within two seconds of the estimated time?\nIt's surgical. And that's one small window and I have never missed it.\nIf I had failed that task, I'd be in trouble with my superiors, with my conscience and with the system.\nBut I hit my target.\nSo, I sleep like a baby.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUm, h-how many...\nchildren...\ndied in this... in this mission?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe media puts it at 16.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd the air force?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe navy, Doctor, listen.\nThe navy says nothing and why should it?\nWe're not into body counts, we just hit targets.\nWe don't look back over our shoulder.\nWe do our thing so you can sit here in peace, talking to people for a living.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n So when did you hear that children had been killed?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe following afternoon. I heard it on the internet.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat exactly did you hear?\nAnything specifically that you remember?\n\n**Patient:**\nLike what? It's not like there's time in the day to be surfing the net, this was a moment, I got away.\nThere's a lot of stuff to keep me busy.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat kind of stuff?\n\n**Patient:**\nMission review, aerial photos, videos. Just data, stuff.\nPreparation versus execution.\nEvery tiny technical aspect of our flight is recorded and analysed by the man.\nThere's nowhere to hide. And that's the way it should be.\nIt's just stuff and more stuff.\nWhen my mother died, my father had a year's worth of stuff to deal with.\nLast will and testament, her office, garden, a lifetime of photo albums.\nAnd every time I talked to him, I'd ask how he was, expecting, uh...\nyou know, that... he'd break down.\nFinally.\n\"It never ends, Alex, it never ends. Your mother left such a mess.\n\"She didn't know she was gonna die.\" And that's all he said.\nAfter less than a year, he met another woman and got married, just like that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow did that make you feel?\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, surprised. A whole life together and not a single tear.\nMm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's interesting that you compare the death of your mother with this mission that you've just flown.\n\n**Patient:**\nThat's very clever of you.\nBut there's no relation whatsoever.\nMy mother's death was the most traumatic event in my life so far.\nThat mission was just another mission for Alex. There is no comparison.\nAnyway, look, that's over and I'm back now at my home base and now I'm on R&R.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat kind of things do you do for R&R?\n\n**Patient:**\nDon't try to get ahead of me.\nI'm a runner. I was a hell of a runner in high school and I'm still a good one for an old man. So, I run with my fairy friend.\nThis gay guy who could kick your ass at any sport.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd does he have a name, this friend?\n\n**Patient:**\nMm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDaniel.\n\n**Patient:**\nDaniel.\nWe've been running together for a long time, between six and ten miles.\nDepending on whether one of us is on his period. Only this time, I challenged him.\nIt was no good running in the Middle East, not for the US military, unless you want a bomb to blow your balls off!\nSo, I wanted to do some serious running. I said, \"Let's go for 15.\" After 15 miles, I said, \"20.\" He didn't want it.\nI said, \"OK, I'll go on my own.\" So, he followed.\nI said, \"You know, only six more and it's a marathon. Let's do it.\" He wanted to stop. Little bitch.\nBut I wasn't gonna stop.\nNo stop.\nWe were out of water, we were on fumes.\nAt 22 miles, I had a heart attack and died.\nA textbook case, straight out of med school.\nEnlargement of the left ventricle, in accordance with the family history on both sides, fatal.\nAccording to the EKG and according to statistics, I had a 97.3 per cent chance of dying.\nOr a 2.7 per cent chance of living. Anyway, dead.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou actually died?\n\n**Patient:**\nIn the clinical sense no pulse, no brain activity, total clinical death.\nBut here I am.\nNow I'm gonna disappoint you, Doctor.\nWanna know why I'm gonna disappoint you?\nLet me help you - the light, the tunnel, life flashing before my eyes.\nThat's what you're interested in, right?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, I wasn't actually thinking of that at all, but I am interested.\nTell me.\n\n**Patient:**\nI couldn't give a shit about it either.\nBut that's all everyone wanted to know about - my father, my wife.\nEveryone wanted to hear about the goddamn tunnel.\nJust such bullshit.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you feel that maybe you disappointed people by not having that experience?\nThat maybe in some way you failed to deliver the goods?\n\n**Patient:**\nNobody really knows what was going through my mind during those last few moments.\nAs soon as there was no more tunnel, no one was interested.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd what was going through your mind?\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, I knew what was happening, you can tell.\nAnd you're afraid it's the end.\nIn all that time until I lost consciousness...\nAll that time... I don't know, it was maybe seconds, maybe half a minute.\nAll that time I kept trying to figure out if I had a hard-on.\nI don't know how I remembered, it was something my grandmother told me, when I was in high school, and she said when Grandpa died, she found him lying naked in the bathtub with a huge erection.\nNow, he's... he was 92 years old.\nShe hadn't seen an erection like that in 20 years.\nShe liked it. She said that was God's final gift to a man.\nA dead man's boner. They call it angel lust.\nAnyway, I'm lying there thinking about that story.\nI know what's happening and I said to myself, \"God Almighty, just don't let me have an erection now, not a hard-on.\" Because if you had an erection, it would mean...\nThat would mean that I was dead.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd your friend Daniel was with you throughout this?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, resuscitation, CPR... Daniel's a doctor. I forgot to say that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh. For a minute I thought you were going to say something else, that perhaps your fear of an erection was associated with the presence of your friend, Daniel.\n\n**Patient:**\nExcuse me?\nYou're exaggerating. I explained something simple, a dead man's erection - what's that got to do with Daniel?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, maybe I didn't make myself clear earlier on when I was talking about the customer always being wrong.\nWhat I meant was that sometimes the patient hides things from his therapist, from himself.\nAnd so part of our job is to uncover the things that we hide.\n\n**Patient:**\n So, my secret is I'm afraid of homosexuals?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, not necessarily. But I just wanted to clarify that.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, that's neither here nor there. I want to get to my point.\nI didn't have the erection, so relax.\nBut I remember very vividly that moment just before passing out, before losing consciousness.\nLosing consciousness, that's a funny expression.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy do you think that's a funny expression?\n\n**Patient:**\nLosing consciousness - it's an expression my father would use.\nEverything in terms of profits and loss.\nFits him like a glove.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo something about how you describe your last moments is equated with your father's seeing things in terms of profit and loss?\n\n**Patient:**\nOK, OK, with all due respect, I think we've come to this way too early.\nThe father-son relationship stuff shouldn't come up so soon.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou think it's too soon?\n\n**Patient:**\nForget what I feel.\nI know it's too soon. I wanna know what you think.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you're... You're testing me?\n\n**Patient:**\nI'm entitled to some testing. I'm paying.\nActually, I think you've been testing me since you walked in.\nYou've asked about me and my reputation, you ask, you practically demand that I ask certain questions that you think I am dying to ask.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's important to you, I think, that I adhere to certain standards you set before you walked through the door.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat's wrong with that? Look, I did my research.\nIt's a 1  1/2 hour drive to get here and I'm paying you good money.\nAnd I'm expected to tell you, a perfect stranger, the most intimate things about my life.\nPlus there are risks here.\nIt's not like the navy's gonna give me a medal for spilling my guts, I'm not gonna open up to you without knowing what you are.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd what do you expect to find, Alex?\nHow are we going to know that I'm a good enough therapist for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nI'll know...\naccording to your opinion.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMy opinion of what?\n\n**Patient:**\nOf the issue I came to talk about.\nBut I'll come to that in a minute.\nIt's to do with what happened after taking me out of the freezer.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe freezer?\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, you mean that you were grounded?\nNo, literally frozen. They froze me.\nThe mobile intensive care unit arrived and put me in a suit that freezes you.\nThey got one no more than three-quarters of a mile from where I collapsed.\nAnd their ER is tops.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLet's go back to this...\n\n**Patient:**\nWe're getting there. You have no patience.\nI was told you're a good listener.\nNow look, it works on a very simple principle.\nIt reduces the shock to the body's systems by dropping the body temperature.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo how long were you...\n\n**Patient:**\nIn my case, 48 hours. It's a record.\nThere's no history of anyone who's been in that suit for such a long time.\nI guess I went a long way up that tunnel.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe tunnel that wasn't there?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, unfortunately not.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo tell me what you remember about this 48 hours.\n\n**Patient:**\nMostly I remember, um... a terrible fatigue.\nI guess that's why they call it \"dead tired\".\nIt's physical, but mainly mental exhaustion.\nAnd I remember very clearly the relief I felt when I succeeded in coming back over into the \nworld.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou say that you succeeded in coming back to this world.\nDid... Did you feel it was under your control?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat are you trying to get at?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'm not trying to get at anything.\nBut what you're describing is a strong will to live.\n\n**Patient:**\nDuring this experience, there was a decision to go on living.\nYeah, I guess you're right.\nDespite having made this effort to live...\neverybody's disappointed.\nIt's not every day people meet someone who's come back from the dead.\nIt's a one-in-a-million thing. And if you don't supply the goods, then...\nListen, I have never spent a day in my life in a hospital.\nYou get it? Never.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo, perhaps your anger isn't directed at those people interested in the tunnel.\nPerhaps you're angry at yourself, Alex. How your body betrayed you.\nThis is a systems failure that was not supposed to happen to somebody like you.\n\n**Patient:**\nHmh.\nI have a brother, who's not bright, he's a real-estate agent.\nAnyway, he's a great athlete. And he once proved to me, and he does his research, believe me...\nthat all the great quarterbacks in the history of football were also the best looking.\nNamath, Staubach, Cunningham, they're all good-Iooking people.\nThe best-Iooking students in the class are often great athletes.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou know why that is?\n\n**Patient:**\nI've no idea.\nIt's got nothing to do with sports.\nWhen they got their gift from God the Father, or whoever the hell doles out the talent, they got the whole package - beauty, talent, character.\nThat's how it is. It's an evolutionary thing.\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy. You are feeling neutral.\nNow, you will make the patient feel at ease.

We had a big blowout screaming, crying, the works.\nThen at some point, I called Ilona, and we went out for a drink, and...\nwe had a few drinks.\nListen, I'm not here.

Why is he calling me here?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMaybe he's worried. You were out all night.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, right. If he really cared, he wouldn't have started with this shit.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nStart what?\n\n**Patient:**\nAt the club with this guy...\nOh, my God.\nHe had corduroy pants on, preppy sweater.\nRepublican probably.\n  Can I just step out for a second and let him know I'm here?\nI can't concentrate with this shit.\nJust a sec.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLaura, the call can wait.\n\n**Patient:**\n Andrew gave me an ultimatum.\nEither we get married or we split.\nSaid he wants an answer in a day or two at the most, or else he's out.\nSaid he can't take it any more.\nThat he loves me, that he doesn't believe I love him, not for real.\nThat it's been two years already, on and off, blah, blah, blah.\nI don't know why. All of a sudden, he just started ranting and raving.\nWe've talked about this stuff before, but it was all in theory if we stayed together, if.\nAnd suddenly out of the blue, I can't even remember what we were doing...\nWe were watching TV.\nAll of a sudden he just gets off the couch, grabs the remote and turns off the TV, and he turns to me and he has tears in his eyes and he says, \"That's it, I can't take it any more.\" So out of line. He promised he'd lay off the subject for a while.\nAnd all of a sudden he's on this crying bullshit.\nHe actually burst out crying. I've never seen him like that before.\nAnd to tell you the truth it really scared me.\nNo, it made me angry.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy?\n\n**Patient:**\nHe's trying to manipulate me with these cheap chick tricks.\nMaybe he thought he would break my heart or something.\nOr appeal to my...\nShit, you know, forget it, I don't know.\nI threw a tantrum like a three-year-old.\nI screamed, cried...\ntold him to fuck off...\ntold him he was a little piece of shit for doing this to me when he knows I'm working double shifts at the hospital this week.\nI slammed the door, smashed his laptop on the floor, I killed it, I ran out and I called Ilona.\nShe dressed me in this outfit.\nIt's, it's not mine.\nWe went out for a drink at a club that she likes on Chester Street.\nShe tried to calm me down, put things into perspective.\nAnd she said...\nShe said that I was lucky...\nthat she wished somebody had loved her enough to give her an ultimatum.\nAnd then we drank. Well, I drank.\nAnd there's this guy at the bar, and at some point Ilona said that she was tired and that she needed to go home.\nAnd then that guy...\nmoved next to me, and, erm...\nYou know what he said?\nHe said, \"You look so sad.\" And I said, \"Really?\" And he said, \"Yeah, you do. It looks good on you.\" \"Looks good on you.\" Whatever happened to, \"Do you have the time?\" or, \"Haven't we met before?\" I must be totally out of touch, Doctor.\nWhat do you think? I mean, do I look good when I'm sad?\nI don't think anybody looks good when they're sad.\nAnd then, er, I don't know how much I had to drink cos he was ordering for me, of course, and then he paid the bill and he asked me, \"Would you like to go somewhere else?\" And I said, \"Yes, I'd like to go to the bathroom.\" So I stood up and I went to the bathroom, he follows me.\nAnd you wouldn't believe it but these were unisex bathrooms.\nAm I unlucky or what?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow do you mean, unlucky?\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, I'm running away from a guy and I'm...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou were trying to get away from the guy.\n\n**Patient:**\nI mean, I needed to pee, by myself, I've been doing that since I was three.\nSo I realise I needed to make a decision.\nBy following me to the bathroom, this guy was also giving me an ultimatum.\nI thought, \"Fuck, out of the pan and into the fire.\" I ran away from one ultimatum, and there was this guy with a hard on giving me another.\nSuddenly I felt like doing it.\nI never had sex in a bathroom before.\nI mean, what, I should go and marry Andrew without ever knowing what a good bathroom fuck's all about?\nIt's part of a young lady's education, isn't it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you wanted to do it but not to get back at Andrew, just for yourself?\n\n**Patient:**\nThat's right.\nA girl being forced into marriage...\nwhat's she supposed to do, die ignorant?\nSo this guy follows me into the stall and...\nsuddenly...\nI was horny.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs hearing about this disgusting to you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. It's not disgusting.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nGo on.\n\n**Patient:**\nHe unzipped, pulled down his pants, and he stood there with this...\nhuge...\nOh, God, I felt like I was 16...\ntouching it for the very first time.\nI was really surprised at how...\nwarm it felt.\nI mean, don't I know that already?\nAnd then he turned me round to face the door...\nand he pulled down my stockings.\nHe lifted up my skirt, put his hand into his back pocket and pulled out a condom.\nI realise this guy's very good at this, he does this a lot, he's a real pro.\nAnd then this guy entered the stall next to us and started peeing, and gushes full volume like a racehorse.\nAnd I thought of Andrew...\nhow... how he pees in the morning, making the same sound.\nMy heart ached, I just...\nIt was so stupid, you know, I just felt so sad all of a sudden, and then he's behind me and he's rubbing up against me and he's feeling me up.\nAnd I thought to myself, \"It's gonna happen any moment now,\" and I just...\nI just couldn't do it.\nI simply closed my legs shut. I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it to Andrew.\nI just couldn't do it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, seems like quite a night out.\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, yeah, that's not the end of it, because this idiot, I told him, \"I'm really sorry but I have a boyfriend, I can't do this.\" And he says, \"Boo-hoo,\" and he grabs my hands and he says, \"Listen, cupcake, you think you can leave me high and dry like this?\" Pointing at his dick.\n\"The least you can do is make it up to me.\" I said to him, \"What do you want? You want some money?\" He said, \"Give me a hand job \"and there'll be no hard feelings.\" And I said to him, \"What's the matter with you? Are you crazy?\" And it was just getting really strange. It was tense. His tone changed.\nAnd then...\nAnd then I thought of you.\nWhat you'd say about it.\nI thought about us going through this in therapy.\nAnd what did you imagine us saying?\nI imagined you not being able to understand it.\nThat you'd be disgusted.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs that why you ran over here?\nTo find out if I would be disgusted?\n\n**Patient:**\nI didn't run.\nI gave him the hand job.\nGod. Excuse me.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n You OK?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. Yeah, I'm fine.\n Yeah.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThank you.\n\n**Patient:**\nWe, erm...\nWe talked about what happened at the, er, the club last night but we never got back to actually talking about Andrew and that argument yesterday.\nI don't wanna be put in this position.\nI don't wanna have this power to decide our future for both of us. I just don't.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you have any idea why Andrew chose this particular time?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat do you mean?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you think that Andrew, just out of the blue, as you said yourself, came up with this idea of an ultimatum?\nDid you notice anything over the last couple of days or weeks that you think might have brought this on?\n\n**Patient:**\nNothing, I don't know. He just lost it.\nShit, don't you know that men are the new women?\nObsessed with weddings and children. And lately he's lost touch with reality.\nHe thinks I'm seeing someone. That's how this whole thing started. It's unbelievable.\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy. You are feeling neutral.\nNow, you will make the patient feel at ease.

It gets, uh...\nIt gets stuck. Hi. I'm your therapist.\n\n**Patient:**\nSophie.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNice to meet you. Come on in.\n\n**Patient:**\nHere?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nDo you need any help with the...\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. It's OK.\nAnna Colden recommended that I talk to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnna Colden?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe's my lawyer. She heard about you from a friend of yours.\nI mean, a friend of hers, not a friend of yours.\nFrom a patient of yours who is a friend of hers. Sorry.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMm. So, Anna Colden recommended you through a patient.\n\n**Patient:**\nDo you know his name?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI don't know.\nSo what did Anna recommend me for?\n\n**Patient:**\nAfter my accident... I told you on the phone about the accident?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\n\n**Patient:**\nThey told me I need the opinion of a psychiatrist because the insurance company of the car that hit me has a problem with my injuries or...\nsomething like that. So that's why I'm here.\nI'm here for your professional opinion, not for...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNot for... Not for therapy?\nSo, let's see if I'm, uh... if I'm getting this right.\nAre you suing the insurance company of the person who hit you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Their insurance company had me talk to a social worker.\nAnd... she started asking me all sorts of annoying questions.\nShe was really annoying so I refused to talk to her.\nShe started talking to me like she knew me, so I refused to talk and that didn't go over so well, so my mother said it would be better if I came to talk to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nRight. So what happened at the accident that requires a psychiatric opinion?\n\n**Patient:**\nI really don't remember what happened.\nI was on my bicycle and a car ran into me and I don't remember what happened next.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat did they tell you afterwards?\n\n**Patient:**\nThat I flew my bike right into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're... You're laughing at that.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat that sounds like, flying straight into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you find that funny, yeah?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause it reminds me of something about two years ago.\nA... A friend of mine, he took me out on this motorbike and he stopped to get something at a convenience store.\nAnyway, I was really bored so I pretended that I knew how to drive it.\nYou put your hands on the handlebars and go like this.\nWell, it was one of those monster bikes.\nJust by turning the handle a little, it just flies.\nSo, suddenly, I'm like, zoom, and it takes off.\nMy head, it whips back like this and when I look down, I realise I'm riding into the street.\nTotally crashed into a car.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nThere was this old woman standing nearby and she saw all this. \"I saw her. She did it on purpose.\n\"She tried to kill herself. She tried to kill herself.\" That's what she was yelling?\nYeah, she was like a crazy woman.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\nCourse, it couldn't have been that funny when it happened, I'm sure?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Not really.\nI wanted to kill her. I was just lying there.\nI couldn't move. I couldn't do anything.\nI wanted to yell, \"Shut up, you... you idiot.\n\"Why are you screaming?\" You know? But I couldn't speak.\nIt's like this feeling...\nwhen somebody says something about you and you can't defend yourself.\nIt's totally unfair.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLike that social worker you were talking about.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat does she have to do with it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, didn't you feel that she was speaking for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, but I could have said something.\nI just didn't want to.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHm.\nSo, tell me a little more about this, uh, this accident.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's all in that report.\n\nWhere did it happen?\n\n**Patient:**\nIn a gas station on Madison near the gym where I train.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you were on the way to the gym?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. I told you I don't remember anything.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you feel comfortable talking about yourself, Sophie?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nMy name is Sophie. I'm 16 years old.\nI've been a gymnast since the age of six and a half.\nI was US junior champion at the age of 12.\nI'm an only child.\nI don't know. What do you wanna know?\nIn another few months are the national trials.\nLast chance to qualify for the Olympics.\nI'm kind of like... an Olympic hopeful.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWow.\nThat's really impressive. Congratulations.\n\n**Patient:**\nThank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo how is life in general?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, apart from the gymnastics.\nHow's life?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's great.\nI just don't have the energy for This Is Your Life right now.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThis Is Your Life? What do... What do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nYou know, like the TV show.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're way too young to know about that show.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's on DVD. My mom's friend watches it all the time.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you think of it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's OK.\nSome of the people on it are so old.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n Why do you think they put old people on that?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Cos they have nothing better to do?\nThey're retired and dying off fast so they put them on the show before it's too late.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo do you think you can help me with this professional opinion or not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's not that simple, Sophie.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause it's not like an X-ray where you can take photographs, look at the results and then you go on your way.\nIt doesn't quite work like that.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nOK, so I guess I'll leave.\nWould you at least like to read what it says in the report?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIf you want me to.\n\n**Patient:**\nLike you already know what it says?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. I've no idea what it says.\n\n**Patient:**\nListen, I didn't come here to talk about myself.\nI just need your opinion.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you want me to give you my opinion based on what I read and the conversation that we've had today, is that it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIs that a problem?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. No.\nI'll write up an opinion and, um...\nwhen you come next week, you can decide whether you want to use it or not.\n\n**Patient:**\nJust like that, without any more questions?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, what kind of questions do you want me to ask?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Shrink-like questions.\nSay, about Mom, Dad, that kind of thing?\nDoesn't sound like you're interested.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy would you say that, Sophie?\nI am very interested in everything that you have to say.\nI mean that.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou spoke to my mother already, didn't you?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI didn't.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou already know what it says in there.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI've never spoken to her.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou did and you're letting me sit here and you know exactly what's in that envelope.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWas I... Was I supposed to talk to her?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat, did you, like, plan everything?\nLike I'm some kind of idiot, you planned some charade?\nWhat's the point? Whatever. She would send me to someone like you.\nI should have listened to my father. He called them a cult of crazies.\nOpen the door for me, please.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd if I did speak to your mom?\n\n**Patient:**\nI knew it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, then?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt means you're a liar, OK?\nCos I know how it's supposed to work.\nYou're supposed to read that report and ask the stupid shrink questions you ask.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoesn't it seems unprofessional to so not do it that way?\nMaybe I have something to say about what it says in there.\nI just wanted to read the report by myself before our meeting next week. That's all.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat meeting next week?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'd like us to meet three or four times for me to form an opinion of you, to get to know you a little.\nDon't you think?\nOtherwise... it wouldn't be professional.\nHm?\nI'll read it now.\nOK?\nSo are all these ships instead of sailing for real?\n\n**Patient:**\nUh-huh.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAt least you won't get seasick.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh...\nI don't know about that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nSometimes I can get quite wobbly just sitting right here.\nYou have to make a round window to the outside.\nThen you'll feel like you're in a real ship.\nDid you really read all those books or is it just to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUh-huh.\n\n**Patient:**\nYes, you read them or yes, you're trying to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nI've read them.\nI feel sorry for the books up there.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh. Why do you feel sorry for them?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhere would you put them?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. They're your fucking books.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou suffer from asthma.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. How do you know that?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThere's an inhaler here.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, thanks. I've been looking everywhere for that. Thank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, you could have died without it?\nAccording to what it says here...\nit looks like you could have died too.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. That would have solved a lot of problems.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat would it solve?\n\n**Patient:**\nNothing. I didn't mean anything by it.\nCan I talk to you like a normal person?\nDo you drive your daughter crazy with questions like this too?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMuch more crazy, believe me.\nHow d'you know I had a daughter?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause you do.\nYou know my mother.\nYou were on the PTA committee at Arlington elementary.\nI was there before I went off to a private school.\nI was in the same year as your daughter.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, why didn't you tell me that before?\n\n**Patient:**\nHm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou said that the, uh... that the social worker spoke to you like she knew you.\n\n**Patient:**\nShe was such a retard.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDid she ask you if, um... if you think about death a lot?\n\n**Patient:**\nHow did you know that?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAccording to what it says here, she was trying to prove that the accident was your fault.\nIt's a good thing you didn't answer any of her questions.\nBy the way, everybody thinks about death.\nI bet she didn't say that, though.\nDid she ask you if you had any specific thoughts about death?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you?\n\n**Patient:**\nDo I what?\nEveryone... Everyone thinks about death and, uh...\nimagines how it will come to them.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you have any more specific thoughts about it?\nI mean, maybe you have certain thoughts that you'd like to talk about.\n\n**Patient:**\nUnless you're worried about what I...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'm not worried.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nIs this how it's going to be for three appointments?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs this a little difficult for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nCan I have some water?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSure.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHang on a minute.\nSorry about this. It's for my little patients, the elves.\nIt's a bendy one.\nYou need help with that?\nMust be really hard to be, uh... be handicapped like that.\nWhat's the hardest thing about it?\n\n**Patient:**\nEveryone treats me like a baby.\nHm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDid you come here by yourself today?\n\n**Patient:**\nYes. By bus.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYour mom didn't offer to drive you?\nYeah, right. She knew there was no chance I'd say yes.\nBefore, when you got angry, when, uh...\nwhen you thought that she'd called me, I asked myself, \"Why didn't she call?\" It makes sense that she would call me first.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI don't... What do you mean?\nI'm trying to figure out why you got so angry when you thought...\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't get it. She did call?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, no.\n\n**Patient:**\nDid she call or not? Tell me already.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, she didn't call.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo why are we back to this again?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause I got the feeling that when you got angry, you wanted your mother to call, just so that \nyou could get angry with her.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou have no idea what I'm looking for.\nYou just don't get it.\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it to Andrew.\nI just couldn't do it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, seems like quite a night out.\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, yeah, that's not the end of it, because this idiot, I told him, \"I'm really sorry but I have a boyfriend, I can't do this.\" And he says, \"Boo-hoo,\" and he grabs my hands and he says, \"Listen, cupcake, you think you can leave me high and dry like this?\" Pointing at his dick.\n\"The least you can do is make it up to me.\" I said to him, \"What do you want? You want some money?\" He said, \"Give me a hand job \"and there'll be no hard feelings.\" And I said to him, \"What's the matter with you? Are you crazy?\" And it was just getting really strange. It was tense. His tone changed.\nAnd then...\nAnd then I thought of you.\nWhat you'd say about it.\nI thought about us going through this in therapy.\nAnd what did you imagine us saying?\nI imagined you not being able to understand it.\nThat you'd be disgusted.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs that why you ran over here?\nTo find out if I would be disgusted?\n\n**Patient:**\nI didn't run.\nI gave him the hand job.\nGod.

I just don't.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you have any idea why Andrew chose this particular time?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat do you mean?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you think that Andrew, just out of the blue, as you said yourself, came up with this idea of an ultimatum?\nDid you notice anything over the last couple of days or weeks that you think might have brought this on?\n\n**Patient:**\nNothing, I don't know. He just lost it.\nShit, don't you know that men are the new women?\nObsessed with weddings and children. And lately he's lost touch with reality.\nHe thinks I'm seeing someone. That's how this whole thing started. It's unbelievable.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI thought you said it came out of nowhere.\nYou were watching TV and then suddenly...\n\n**Patient:**\nWe were watching TV but, before that, we were having dinner and he had this look on his face, this sad look, and I could tell something was up. You can just tell, right?\nAnd I said to him, \"What's going on?\" And he said, \"I don't know what I want, \"I just know I don't want this on-and-off thing.\" So I said to him, \"Sure.\" And then, \"Let's just decide, either we get married or we split.\"\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you were the one who came up with it.\n\n**Patient:**\nWith what?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe ultimatum.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, he's the one.\nHe had the problem with the on-and-off thing.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYeah, but on and off can mean several things.\nYou were the one who made it specific get married or to split up, that was your ultimatum.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, no, no, he had this thing with this on and o...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe ultim...\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, OK. I was the first one to say it, you're right.\nBut he jumped all over it. I said I didn't know what I want and he said, \"You have a day or two max to decide what you want.\" And I said, \"Fine.\" And then he started crying and blah, blah, blah.\nThe whole thing was scary to him, I think.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat about you? Weren't you scared?\n\n**Patient:**\nOf what?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOf splitting up.\n\n**Patient:**\nI wasn't suggesting that we split up. That's not the point.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what do you think was the point of this argument that you may have initiated?\n\n**Patient:**\nI didn't initiate anything.\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

I just don't.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you have any idea why Andrew chose this particular time?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat do you mean?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you think that Andrew, just out of the blue, as you said yourself, came up with this idea of an ultimatum?\nDid you notice anything over the last couple of days or weeks that you think might have brought this on?\n\n**Patient:**\nNothing, I don't know. He just lost it.\nShit, don't you know that men are the new women?\nObsessed with weddings and children. And lately he's lost touch with reality.\nHe thinks I'm seeing someone. That's how this whole thing started. It's unbelievable.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI thought you said it came out of nowhere.\nYou were watching TV and then suddenly...\n\n**Patient:**\nWe were watching TV but, before that, we were having dinner and he had this look on his face, this sad look, and I could tell something was up. You can just tell, right?\nAnd I said to him, \"What's going on?\" And he said, \"I don't know what I want, \"I just know I don't want this on-and-off thing.\" So I said to him, \"Sure.\" And then, \"Let's just decide, either we get married or we split.\"\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you were the one who came up with it.\n\n**Patient:**\nWith what?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe ultimatum.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, he's the one.\nHe had the problem with the on-and-off thing.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYeah, but on and off can mean several things.\nYou were the one who made it specific get married or to split up, that was your ultimatum.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, no, no, he had this thing with this on and o...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe ultim...\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, OK. I was the first one to say it, you're right.\nBut he jumped all over it. I said I didn't know what I want and he said, \"You have a day or two max to decide what you want.\" And I said, \"Fine.\" And then he started crying and blah, blah, blah.\nThe whole thing was scary to him, I think.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat about you? Weren't you scared?\n\n**Patient:**\nOf what?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOf splitting up.\n\n**Patient:**\nI wasn't suggesting that we split up. That's not the point.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what do you think was the point of this argument that you may have initiated?\n\n**Patient:**\nI didn't initiate anything.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, you may not have meant to, but you did.\nIt sounds like you wanted to bring this relationship into crisis.\nI know you say that Andrew hates uncertainties but perhaps you're the one who can't live with them.\nWhy did you choose this particular time to bring things to a head?\n\n**Patient:**\nI did no such thing.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy now?\n\n**Patient:**\nCos he's right.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAndrew's right.\n\n**Patient:**\nI am being unfaithful to him.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou mean what happened last night at the club?\n\n**Patient:**\nNot just last night.\nI've been unfaithful to him for a long time.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo, why haven't we talked about this before?\n\n**Patient:**\nI think we have.\nIt's been here all along.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou mean to say you've never noticed it?\n\n**Patient:**\nYou're surprised.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, I'm not surprised, I just... I don't follow what you mean.\n\n**Patient:**\nThis isn't...\nthe reaction I was hoping for.\nNot at all.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat was the reaction that you were hoping for?\n\n**Patient:**\nI...\nI had two scenarios in my head.\nIn the first one, you stand up and you hug me...\nand you say, \"I love you.\n\"Love you too, Laura.\n\"I've been feeling this way for a long time, \"I just wanted you to be the first one to say it.\" And then we make love.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd the, erm...\nthe second scenario?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's like the first one but...\nbut without the sex, we just sit here together.\nYou know, I'm embarrassed to even talk about it.\nYou're sitting there like a fucking Buddha, acting like you have no idea what I'm talking about. It's humiliating.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow long have you felt like this?\n\n**Patient:**\nA year.\nFrom the first session.\nI thought it'd go away, I thought, \"It's just an infatuation, that's all.\" But it's getting worse.\nYou've become the centre of my life.\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

Come on in.\n\n**Patient:**\nHere?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nDo you need any help with the...\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. It's OK.\nAnna Colden recommended that I talk to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnna Colden?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe's my lawyer. She heard about you from a friend of yours.\nI mean, a friend of hers, not a friend of yours.\nFrom a patient of yours who is a friend of hers. Sorry.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMm. So, Anna Colden recommended you through a patient.\n\n**Patient:**\nDo you know his name?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI don't know.\nSo what did Anna recommend me for?\n\n**Patient:**\nAfter my accident... I told you on the phone about the accident?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\n\n**Patient:**\nThey told me I need the opinion of a psychiatrist because the insurance company of the car that hit me has a problem with my injuries or...\nsomething like that. So that's why I'm here.\nI'm here for your professional opinion, not for...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNot for... Not for therapy?\nSo, let's see if I'm, uh... if I'm getting this right.\nAre you suing the insurance company of the person who hit you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Their insurance company had me talk to a social worker.\nAnd... she started asking me all sorts of annoying questions.\nShe was really annoying so I refused to talk to her.\nShe started talking to me like she knew me, so I refused to talk and that didn't go over so well, so my mother said it would be better if I came to talk to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nRight. So what happened at the accident that requires a psychiatric opinion?\n\n**Patient:**\nI really don't remember what happened.\nI was on my bicycle and a car ran into me and I don't remember what happened next.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat did they tell you afterwards?\n\n**Patient:**\nThat I flew my bike right into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're... You're laughing at that.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat that sounds like, flying straight into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you find that funny, yeah?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause it reminds me of something about two years ago.\nA... A friend of mine, he took me out on this motorbike and he stopped to get something at a convenience store.\nAnyway, I was really bored so I pretended that I knew how to drive it.\nYou put your hands on the handlebars and go like this.\nWell, it was one of those monster bikes.\nJust by turning the handle a little, it just flies.\nSo, suddenly, I'm like, zoom, and it takes off.\nMy head, it whips back like this and when I look down, I realise I'm riding into the street.\nTotally crashed into a car.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nThere was this old woman standing nearby and she saw all this. \"I saw her. She did it on purpose.\n\"She tried to kill herself. She tried to kill herself.\" That's what she was yelling?\nYeah, she was like a crazy woman.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\nCourse, it couldn't have been that funny when it happened, I'm sure?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Not really.\nI wanted to kill her. I was just lying there.\nI couldn't move. I couldn't do anything.\nI wanted to yell, \"Shut up, you... you idiot.\n\"Why are you screaming?\" You know? But I couldn't speak.\nIt's like this feeling...\nwhen somebody says something about you and you can't defend yourself.\nIt's totally unfair.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLike that social worker you were talking about.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat does she have to do with it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, didn't you feel that she was speaking for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, but I could have said something.\nI just didn't want to.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHm.\nSo, tell me a little more about this, uh, this accident.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's all in that report.\n\nWhere did it happen?\n\n**Patient:**\nIn a gas station on Madison near the gym where I train.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you were on the way to the gym?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. I told you I don't remember anything.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you feel comfortable talking about yourself, Sophie?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nMy name is Sophie. I'm 16 years old.\nI've been a gymnast since the age of six and a half.\nI was US junior champion at the age of 12.\nI'm an only child.\nI don't know. What do you wanna know?\nIn another few months are the national trials.\nLast chance to qualify for the Olympics.\nI'm kind of like... an Olympic hopeful.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWow.\nThat's really impressive. Congratulations.\n\n**Patient:**\nThank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo how is life in general?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, apart from the gymnastics.\nHow's life?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's great.\nI just don't have the energy for This Is Your Life right now.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThis Is Your Life? What do... What do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nYou know, like the TV show.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're way too young to know about that show.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's on DVD. My mom's friend watches it all the time.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you think of it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's OK.\nSome of the people on it are so old.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n Why do you think they put old people on that?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Cos they have nothing better to do?\nThey're retired and dying off fast so they put them on the show before it's too late.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo do you think you can help me with this professional opinion or not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's not that simple, Sophie.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause it's not like an X-ray where you can take photographs, look at the results and then you go on your way.\nIt doesn't quite work like that.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nOK, so I guess I'll leave.\nWould you at least like to read what it says in the report?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIf you want me to.\n\n**Patient:**\nLike you already know what it says?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. I've no idea what it says.\n\n**Patient:**\nListen, I didn't come here to talk about myself.\nI just need your opinion.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you want me to give you my opinion based on what I read and the conversation that we've had today, is that it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIs that a problem?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. No.\nI'll write up an opinion and, um...\nwhen you come next week, you can decide whether you want to use it or not.\n\n**Patient:**\nJust like that, without any more questions?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, what kind of questions do you want me to ask?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Shrink-like questions.\nSay, about Mom, Dad, that kind of thing?\nDoesn't sound like you're interested.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy would you say that, Sophie?\nI am very interested in everything that you have to say.\nI mean that.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou spoke to my mother already, didn't you?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI didn't.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou already know what it says in there.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI've never spoken to her.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou did and you're letting me sit here and you know exactly what's in that envelope.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWas I... Was I supposed to talk to her?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat, did you, like, plan everything?\nLike I'm some kind of idiot, you planned some charade?\nWhat's the point? Whatever. She would send me to someone like you.\nI should have listened to my father. He called them a cult of crazies.\nOpen the door for me, please.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd if I did speak to your mom?\n\n**Patient:**\nI knew it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, then?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt means you're a liar, OK?\nCos I know how it's supposed to work.\nYou're supposed to read that report and ask the stupid shrink questions you ask.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoesn't it seems unprofessional to so not do it that way?\nMaybe I have something to say about what it says in there.\nI just wanted to read the report by myself before our meeting next week. That's all.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat meeting next week?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'd like us to meet three or four times for me to form an opinion of you, to get to know you a little.\nDon't you think?\nOtherwise... it wouldn't be professional.\nHm?\nI'll read it now.\nOK?\nSo are all these ships instead of sailing for real?\n\n**Patient:**\nUh-huh.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAt least you won't get seasick.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh...\nI don't know about that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nSometimes I can get quite wobbly just sitting right here.\nYou have to make a round window to the outside.\nThen you'll feel like you're in a real ship.\nDid you really read all those books or is it just to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUh-huh.\n\n**Patient:**\nYes, you read them or yes, you're trying to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nI've read them.\nI feel sorry for the books up there.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh. Why do you feel sorry for them?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhere would you put them?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. They're your fucking books.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou suffer from asthma.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. How do you know that?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThere's an inhaler here.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, thanks. I've been looking everywhere for that. Thank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, you could have died without it?\nAccording to what it says here...\nit looks like you could have died too.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. That would have solved a lot of problems.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat would it solve?\n\n**Patient:**\nNothing. I didn't mean anything by it.\nCan I talk to you like a normal person?\nDo you drive your daughter crazy with questions like this too?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMuch more crazy, believe me.\nHow d'you know I had a daughter?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause you do.\nYou know my mother.\nYou were on the PTA committee at Arlington elementary.\nI was there before I went off to a private school.\nI was in the same year as your daughter.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, why didn't you tell me that before?\n\n**Patient:**\nHm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou said that the, uh... that the social worker spoke to you like she knew you.\n\n**Patient:**\nShe was such a retard.\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

She heard about you from a friend of yours.\nI mean, a friend of hers, not a friend of yours.\nFrom a patient of yours who is a friend of hers. Sorry.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMm. So, Anna Colden recommended you through a patient.\n\n**Patient:**\nDo you know his name?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI don't know.\nSo what did Anna recommend me for?\n\n**Patient:**\nAfter my accident... I told you on the phone about the accident?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\n\n**Patient:**\nThey told me I need the opinion of a psychiatrist because the insurance company of the car that hit me has a problem with my injuries or...\nsomething like that. So that's why I'm here.\nI'm here for your professional opinion, not for...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNot for... Not for therapy?\nSo, let's see if I'm, uh... if I'm getting this right.\nAre you suing the insurance company of the person who hit you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Their insurance company had me talk to a social worker.\nAnd... she started asking me all sorts of annoying questions.\nShe was really annoying so I refused to talk to her.\nShe started talking to me like she knew me, so I refused to talk and that didn't go over so well, so my mother said it would be better if I came to talk to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nRight. So what happened at the accident that requires a psychiatric opinion?\n\n**Patient:**\nI really don't remember what happened.\nI was on my bicycle and a car ran into me and I don't remember what happened next.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat did they tell you afterwards?\n\n**Patient:**\nThat I flew my bike right into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're... You're laughing at that.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat that sounds like, flying straight into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you find that funny, yeah?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause it reminds me of something about two years ago.\nA... A friend of mine, he took me out on this motorbike and he stopped to get something at a convenience store.\nAnyway, I was really bored so I pretended that I knew how to drive it.\nYou put your hands on the handlebars and go like this.\nWell, it was one of those monster bikes.\nJust by turning the handle a little, it just flies.\nSo, suddenly, I'm like, zoom, and it takes off.\nMy head, it whips back like this and when I look down, I realise I'm riding into the street.\nTotally crashed into a car.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nThere was this old woman standing nearby and she saw all this. \"I saw her. She did it on purpose.\n\"She tried to kill herself. She tried to kill herself.\" That's what she was yelling?\nYeah, she was like a crazy woman.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\nCourse, it couldn't have been that funny when it happened, I'm sure?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Not really.\nI wanted to kill her. I was just lying there.\nI couldn't move. I couldn't do anything.\nI wanted to yell, \"Shut up, you... you idiot.\n\"Why are you screaming?\" You know? But I couldn't speak.\nIt's like this feeling...\nwhen somebody says something about you and you can't defend yourself.\nIt's totally unfair.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLike that social worker you were talking about.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat does she have to do with it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, didn't you feel that she was speaking for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, but I could have said something.\nI just didn't want to.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHm.\nSo, tell me a little more about this, uh, this accident.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's all in that report.\n\nWhere did it happen?\n\n**Patient:**\nIn a gas station on Madison near the gym where I train.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you were on the way to the gym?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. I told you I don't remember anything.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you feel comfortable talking about yourself, Sophie?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nMy name is Sophie. I'm 16 years old.\nI've been a gymnast since the age of six and a half.\nI was US junior champion at the age of 12.\nI'm an only child.\nI don't know. What do you wanna know?\nIn another few months are the national trials.\nLast chance to qualify for the Olympics.\nI'm kind of like... an Olympic hopeful.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWow.\nThat's really impressive. Congratulations.\n\n**Patient:**\nThank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo how is life in general?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, apart from the gymnastics.\nHow's life?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's great.\nI just don't have the energy for This Is Your Life right now.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThis Is Your Life? What do... What do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nYou know, like the TV show.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're way too young to know about that show.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's on DVD. My mom's friend watches it all the time.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you think of it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's OK.\nSome of the people on it are so old.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n Why do you think they put old people on that?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Cos they have nothing better to do?\nThey're retired and dying off fast so they put them on the show before it's too late.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo do you think you can help me with this professional opinion or not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's not that simple, Sophie.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause it's not like an X-ray where you can take photographs, look at the results and then you go on your way.\nIt doesn't quite work like that.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nOK, so I guess I'll leave.\nWould you at least like to read what it says in the report?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIf you want me to.\n\n**Patient:**\nLike you already know what it says?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. I've no idea what it says.\n\n**Patient:**\nListen, I didn't come here to talk about myself.\nI just need your opinion.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you want me to give you my opinion based on what I read and the conversation that we've had today, is that it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIs that a problem?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. No.\nI'll write up an opinion and, um...\nwhen you come next week, you can decide whether you want to use it or not.\n\n**Patient:**\nJust like that, without any more questions?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, what kind of questions do you want me to ask?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Shrink-like questions.\nSay, about Mom, Dad, that kind of thing?\nDoesn't sound like you're interested.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy would you say that, Sophie?\nI am very interested in everything that you have to say.\nI mean that.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou spoke to my mother already, didn't you?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI didn't.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou already know what it says in there.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI've never spoken to her.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou did and you're letting me sit here and you know exactly what's in that envelope.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWas I... Was I supposed to talk to her?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat, did you, like, plan everything?\nLike I'm some kind of idiot, you planned some charade?\nWhat's the point? Whatever. She would send me to someone like you.\nI should have listened to my father. He called them a cult of crazies.\nOpen the door for me, please.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd if I did speak to your mom?\n\n**Patient:**\nI knew it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, then?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt means you're a liar, OK?\nCos I know how it's supposed to work.\nYou're supposed to read that report and ask the stupid shrink questions you ask.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoesn't it seems unprofessional to so not do it that way?\nMaybe I have something to say about what it says in there.\nI just wanted to read the report by myself before our meeting next week. That's all.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat meeting next week?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'd like us to meet three or four times for me to form an opinion of you, to get to know you a little.\nDon't you think?\nOtherwise... it wouldn't be professional.\nHm?\nI'll read it now.\nOK?\nSo are all these ships instead of sailing for real?\n\n**Patient:**\nUh-huh.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAt least you won't get seasick.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh...\nI don't know about that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nSometimes I can get quite wobbly just sitting right here.\nYou have to make a round window to the outside.\nThen you'll feel like you're in a real ship.\nDid you really read all those books or is it just to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUh-huh.\n\n**Patient:**\nYes, you read them or yes, you're trying to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nI've read them.\nI feel sorry for the books up there.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh. Why do you feel sorry for them?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhere would you put them?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. They're your fucking books.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou suffer from asthma.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. How do you know that?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThere's an inhaler here.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, thanks. I've been looking everywhere for that. Thank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, you could have died without it?\nAccording to what it says here...\nit looks like you could have died too.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. That would have solved a lot of problems.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat would it solve?\n\n**Patient:**\nNothing. I didn't mean anything by it.\nCan I talk to you like a normal person?\nDo you drive your daughter crazy with questions like this too?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMuch more crazy, believe me.\nHow d'you know I had a daughter?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause you do.\nYou know my mother.\nYou were on the PTA committee at Arlington elementary.\nI was there before I went off to a private school.\nI was in the same year as your daughter.\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

So what happened at the accident that requires a psychiatric opinion?\n\n**Patient:**\nI really don't remember what happened.\nI was on my bicycle and a car ran into me and I don't remember what happened next.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat did they tell you afterwards?\n\n**Patient:**\nThat I flew my bike right into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're... You're laughing at that.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat that sounds like, flying straight into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you find that funny, yeah?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause it reminds me of something about two years ago.\nA... A friend of mine, he took me out on this motorbike and he stopped to get something at a convenience store.\nAnyway, I was really bored so I pretended that I knew how to drive it.\nYou put your hands on the handlebars and go like this.\nWell, it was one of those monster bikes.\nJust by turning the handle a little, it just flies.\nSo, suddenly, I'm like, zoom, and it takes off.\nMy head, it whips back like this and when I look down, I realise I'm riding into the street.\nTotally crashed into a car.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nThere was this old woman standing nearby and she saw all this. \"I saw her. She did it on purpose.\n\"She tried to kill herself. She tried to kill herself.\" That's what she was yelling?\nYeah, she was like a crazy woman.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\nCourse, it couldn't have been that funny when it happened, I'm sure?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Not really.\nI wanted to kill her. I was just lying there.\nI couldn't move. I couldn't do anything.\nI wanted to yell, \"Shut up, you... you idiot.\n\"Why are you screaming?\" You know? But I couldn't speak.\nIt's like this feeling...\nwhen somebody says something about you and you can't defend yourself.\nIt's totally unfair.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLike that social worker you were talking about.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat does she have to do with it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, didn't you feel that she was speaking for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, but I could have said something.\nI just didn't want to.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHm.\nSo, tell me a little more about this, uh, this accident.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's all in that report.\n\nWhere did it happen?\n\n**Patient:**\nIn a gas station on Madison near the gym where I train.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you were on the way to the gym?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. I told you I don't remember anything.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you feel comfortable talking about yourself, Sophie?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nMy name is Sophie. I'm 16 years old.\nI've been a gymnast since the age of six and a half.\nI was US junior champion at the age of 12.\nI'm an only child.\nI don't know. What do you wanna know?\nIn another few months are the national trials.\nLast chance to qualify for the Olympics.\nI'm kind of like... an Olympic hopeful.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWow.\nThat's really impressive. Congratulations.\n\n**Patient:**\nThank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo how is life in general?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, apart from the gymnastics.\nHow's life?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's great.\nI just don't have the energy for This Is Your Life right now.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThis Is Your Life? What do... What do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nYou know, like the TV show.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're way too young to know about that show.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's on DVD. My mom's friend watches it all the time.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you think of it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's OK.\nSome of the people on it are so old.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n Why do you think they put old people on that?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Cos they have nothing better to do?\nThey're retired and dying off fast so they put them on the show before it's too late.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo do you think you can help me with this professional opinion or not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's not that simple, Sophie.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause it's not like an X-ray where you can take photographs, look at the results and then you go on your way.\nIt doesn't quite work like that.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nOK, so I guess I'll leave.\nWould you at least like to read what it says in the report?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIf you want me to.\n\n**Patient:**\nLike you already know what it says?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. I've no idea what it says.\n\n**Patient:**\nListen, I didn't come here to talk about myself.\nI just need your opinion.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you want me to give you my opinion based on what I read and the conversation that we've had today, is that it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIs that a problem?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. No.\nI'll write up an opinion and, um...\nwhen you come next week, you can decide whether you want to use it or not.\n\n**Patient:**\nJust like that, without any more questions?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, what kind of questions do you want me to ask?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Shrink-like questions.\nSay, about Mom, Dad, that kind of thing?\nDoesn't sound like you're interested.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy would you say that, Sophie?\nI am very interested in everything that you have to say.\nI mean that.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou spoke to my mother already, didn't you?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI didn't.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou already know what it says in there.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI've never spoken to her.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou did and you're letting me sit here and you know exactly what's in that envelope.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWas I... Was I supposed to talk to her?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat, did you, like, plan everything?\nLike I'm some kind of idiot, you planned some charade?\nWhat's the point? Whatever. She would send me to someone like you.\nI should have listened to my father. He called them a cult of crazies.\nOpen the door for me, please.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd if I did speak to your mom?\n\n**Patient:**\nI knew it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, then?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt means you're a liar, OK?\nCos I know how it's supposed to work.\nYou're supposed to read that report and ask the stupid shrink questions you ask.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoesn't it seems unprofessional to so not do it that way?\nMaybe I have something to say about what it says in there.\nI just wanted to read the report by myself before our meeting next week. That's all.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat meeting next week?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'd like us to meet three or four times for me to form an opinion of you, to get to know you a little.\nDon't you think?\nOtherwise... it wouldn't be professional.\nHm?\nI'll read it now.\nOK?\nSo are all these ships instead of sailing for real?\n\n**Patient:**\nUh-huh.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAt least you won't get seasick.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh...\nI don't know about that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nSometimes I can get quite wobbly just sitting right here.\nYou have to make a round window to the outside.\nThen you'll feel like you're in a real ship.\nDid you really read all those books or is it just to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUh-huh.\n\n**Patient:**\nYes, you read them or yes, you're trying to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nI've read them.\nI feel sorry for the books up there.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh. Why do you feel sorry for them?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhere would you put them?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. They're your fucking books.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou suffer from asthma.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. How do you know that?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThere's an inhaler here.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, thanks. I've been looking everywhere for that. Thank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, you could have died without it?\nAccording to what it says here...\nit looks like you could have died too.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. That would have solved a lot of problems.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat would it solve?\n\n**Patient:**\nNothing. I didn't mean anything by it.\nCan I talk to you like a normal person?\nDo you drive your daughter crazy with questions like this too?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMuch more crazy, believe me.\nHow d'you know I had a daughter?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause you do.\nYou know my mother.\nYou were on the PTA committee at Arlington elementary.\nI was there before I went off to a private school.\nI was in the same year as your daughter.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, why didn't you tell me that before?\n\n**Patient:**\nHm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou said that the, uh... that the social worker spoke to you like she knew you.\n\n**Patient:**\nShe was such a retard.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDid she ask you if, um... if you think about death a lot?\n\n**Patient:**\nHow did you know that?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAccording to what it says here, she was trying to prove that the accident was your fault.\nIt's a good thing you didn't answer any of her questions.\nBy the way, everybody thinks about death.\nI bet she didn't say that, though.\nDid she ask you if you had any specific thoughts about death?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you?\n\n**Patient:**\nDo I what?\nEveryone... Everyone thinks about death and, uh...\nimagines how it will come to them.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you have any more specific thoughts about it?\nI mean, maybe you have certain thoughts that you'd like to talk about.\n\n**Patient:**\nUnless you're worried about what I...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'm not worried.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nIs this how it's going to be for three appointments?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs this a little difficult for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nCan I have some water?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSure.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHang on a minute.\nSorry about this. It's for my little patients, the elves.\nIt's a bendy one.\nYou need help with that?\nMust be really hard to be, uh... be handicapped like that.\nWhat's the hardest thing about it?\n\n**Patient:**\nEveryone treats me like a baby.\nHm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDid you come here by yourself today?\n\n**Patient:**\nYes. By bus.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYour mom didn't offer to drive you?\nYeah, right. She knew there was no chance I'd say yes.\nBefore, when you got angry, when, uh...\nwhen you thought that she'd called me, I asked myself, \"Why didn't she call?\" It makes sense that she would call me first.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI don't... What do you mean?\nI'm trying to figure out why you got so angry when you thought...\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't get it. She did call?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, no.\n\n**Patient:**\nDid she call or not? Tell me already.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, she didn't call.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo why are we back to this again?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause I got the feeling that when you got angry, you wanted your mother to call, just so that \nyou could get angry with her.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou have no idea what I'm looking for.\nYou just don't get it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOK.\nSo...\nwhy don't you explain it to me, then?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe thinks that what's written there is true.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat's true?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhatever it says. \"Suicidal tendencies\", blah, blah, blah.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThat's what your mother says is true?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe thinks that this accident is an opportunity to get rid of the sports thing.\nThat's what she calls it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBut what does that have to do with this report?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe's afraid.\nShe doesn't believe that...\nShe thinks that, because of all this competition and perfectionism, she thinks that I wanted to kill myself. And that's bullshit.\nIt's been like this for years.\nI've been under pressure for years and she has never supported me.\nAll the other mothers are right there, all over us, visiting the gym, the training camps, all of it.\nAnd the only thing she has to say is, \"What do you need this for?\" It's obvious she doesn't understand anything.\nAll this pressure, it doesn't make any difference.\nIt's so silly. Why would I hurt myself now, just before the nationals when I have all the...\nAnd if I fail the lawsuit, I really have no chance.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you mean, fail? Do you see this as a kind of test?\nTell me, why do you...\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy are you making it sound like it's...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat?\n\n**Patient:**\nI didn't come here for therapy.\nI just need you to write your opinion and tell me that I'm perfectly all right and tell them that I'm not some crazy who flies into cars every day.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs that why you came here today, Sophie?\nFor me to tell you that you're all right, that you're not crazy?\nIs that the test you're afraid of failing?\n\n**Patient:**\nI have to go.\nIt's ten to already.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou probably have to turn on your cellphone now.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy? Are you worried that I won't be available?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo.\n\n**Patient:**\nAre you this much of a pain in the ass with your daughter?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMuch, much worse, believe me.\nAnd yes, I do try to understand my daughter, if that's what you're asking.\n\n**Patient:**\nThat's not what I'm asking.\nLet's say she wants to talk to you now.\nWhat will she do? I don't think she'll wait till ten to so she can talk to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWho do you call, Sophie?\n\n**Patient:**\nNow you don't feel comfortable talking about your daughter.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nShe calls me at ten minutes before the hour, she leaves a message and I get back to her.\nBut who do you call?\n\n**Patient:**\nWho do I call for what?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhen you need to talk to someone.\n\n**Patient:**\nFour, one, one.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nFour, one, one?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah.\nHe's my father. He's moved so many times in the past few years, I can never remember his latest phone number.\nIt's like a family joke. We call four, one, one.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow do you get on with your dad?\n\n**Patient:**\nHe's always there for me.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you mean, he's always there for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nHe's there. He knows what's happening to me.\nWhen I had the accident, he called me when I was in the ambulance.\nHe knew something had happened. That's what they told me.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh. So is it like you guys have a kind of telepathy together?\n\n**Patient:**\nHe's the only person in this world who truly loves me and the only one that believes that the accident was not my fault.\nThe only one except Cy.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWho's Cy?\n\n**Patient:**\nThis is Cy.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nCy is a mermaid?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, Cy drew it.\nHe's my coach. Dana coloured it, that's his daughter.\nI used to be her baby-sitter.\nDo I have to go now?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nSo you baby-sit for your coach?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, since before I joined his gym.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh. So Cy is the only one, apart from your dad, who loves you?\nOr he's the only one who thinks that you didn't crash your bike on purpose?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Is that important for your professional opinion?\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy. You are feeling neutral.\nNow, you will make the patient feel at ease.

Your wife too.\nBut you wouldn't come, would you? Of course you wouldn't.\nBut we did actually talk about it yesterday, right after I said yes, we started making a guest list and for a few minutes you were on it.\nWait a minute, you said yes just yesterday?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYeah.\nI couldn't make up my mind.\nIt took me a few days to get over the other night and our session.\nI, uh... I wanted to calm down first.\n\n**Patient:**\nAndrew was cool, he said a day here or there wouldn't matter as long as I was moving towards a decision.\nYou know, he's very happy that you're helping me.\nFor a while there, he thought he'd made a mistake recommending that I come see you.\nHe thinks you're an amazing therapist and that his instincts were just right, and that you're on our side.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat?\nUh... I guess I'm just trying to get used to...\nto the change in tone.\nYou're speaking in the plural.\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, I'm gonna be a \"we\", an \"us\", aren't I?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou say that like you're not so sure.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, I'm sure.\nYou know, Doctor, I'm generally open to your interpretations, but it just seems like you're being a bit of a...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nKilljoy?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, something like that. So don't.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nJoy is a very rare thing when it comes to me.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'm...\nI'm just wondering if you came here today determined to, uh...\ndemonstrate that joy, especially after last week's events.\nI'm asking myself if this isn't a bit too fast, if you haven't perhaps taken a short cut.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou think that I'm faking this? That I'm actually totally depressed?\nWell, maybe it's you that's faking it, huh?\nI mean, that congratulations was a bit laboured, don't you think?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI...\nI don't know if you know anything about, um, scuba diving.\nThey have this thing that's called the bends.\nIt's something that happens when the divers come up to the surface too quickly.\nIt's really dangerous.\nIt can explode your lungs from the sudden changes in pressure.\nAnyway, it...\nit seems like there's... there's a huge gap between...\nthe depths that you reached last week and the heights...\nat which you are today. I'm just trying to...\nI'm just trying to adjust myself so that I don't, uh...\nI guess, come to the surface too quickly.\n\n**Patient:**\nDo you dive, Doctor?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nI... Well, w-we used to.\n\n**Patient:**\nOoh, who's speaking in the plural now?\nI can't imagine you diving.\nWhere'd you go? Mexico? The Caribbean?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAre you interested in...\nscuba diving?\n\n**Patient:**\nI'm a certified diver.\nI know what the bends are.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSorry.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, seriously, I dove a lot before I met Andrew.\nHe hates it and he's claustrophobic.\nIt's nice to find we have something in common, you and me, isn't it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhere are you now, Laura?\n\n**Patient:**\nI just had a scary thought. I just, um...\nI know it's silly but...\nbeforehand when you said your...\nyour lungs could explode, it was just the thought that something might happen to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYet you're the one who ascended so fast.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou know what, Doctor? I don't want a depressing session.\nI want a happy session. I came with good news, so show a little support.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOK.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK, yesterday, um, I was at Natalie's, you know, Andrew's ex, and Gary, the husband. The ones who had a baby a few months ago.\nThey keep inviting us over and I keep avoiding them but yesterday they invited us for brunch...\nAnyway, Gary makes dim sum. He has those bamboo steamers and everything.\nSo I said to Andrew, \"OK, let's go.\" He's been so sweet all week, I thought it was the least I could do.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo his agreeing to postpone the ultimatum, that...\ndisarmed you?\nAll right. Go ahead.\n\n**Patient:**\nThey have a baby. These huge eyes.\nThe baby is all eyes, so beautiful.\nAnd the way he breast-feeds, all morning he was attached to Natalie's nipple, this huge dark nipple - I've never seen anything like it.\nAt one point she took her boob out of the baby's mouth and squeezed it and some milk squirted out.\nAnd Andrew has this admiring smile on his face, you know, like he was looking at some masterpiece in a museum, like the Madonna.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you think he saw?\nMaybe an image of you and he together in the future, maybe?\n\n**Patient:**\nOr maybe he just misses her tits.\nNo, not really. They're not that nice.\nShe's changed since she had the baby.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIn what way?\n\n**Patient:**\nI didn't really know her before but Andrew told me a lot about her.\nHe said she was this wild type, you know, who had a lot of guys chasing her.\nShe put him through hell. He said they'd go to bed and she'd be one person, they'd wake up and she'd be someone totally new.\nA free radical, that's what he used to call her.\nHe says I remind him of her.\nThat's scary. Like this is what's left of her, her T-shirt's soaking wet and nipples - nipples, that's all that's left.\nShe's like a wild animal that's somehow been...\nShit, what's the word?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDomesticated?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, she looked domesticated, house-broken.\nShe said her wildest sexual fantasy was to sleep four hours straight.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoes that scare you a little?\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, my God.\nI'd die if I turned into a lousy lay, someone who gets fucked in her sleep.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you think that's what happens when people get married?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Does it?\nIs sex something you forget how to do? Or is it like riding a bike?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI think that depends on the...\non the couple.\nOf course, sex, uh...\ncan be...\na subterfuge, it can...\n\n**Patient:**\nDoctor.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOK.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK...\nSo anyway, I go to the kitchen to help out with something and when I come back Andrew and Gary are engrossed in this deep conversation about - you won't believe this - upholsterers.\nThere's this upholsterer who redid their living room and Andrew's taking the guy's number. I'm like, \"What are you doing?\" He said, \"You and I discussed recovering those armchairs your dad gave you.\" I'm telling you, we never discussed this and all of a sudden Andrew's reupholstering armchairs?\nI mean, we're talking metrosexual.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt doesn't sound like the Andrew you've been talking about.\n\n**Patient:**\nExactly! I mean, this was beyond metrosexual.\nDo you ever watch, uh, the Animal Planet?\nYeah, well, it was about this type of bird. I can't remember the name of it, but anyway, the male bird builds a nest for the female.\nYou know, these amazingly intricate structures.\nThey're incredible.\nAnyway, the female goes from nest to nest, you know, checking out all her various mating options, trying to make up her mind, while the male bird is desperately flapping about, trying to attract the female with his architecture.\nYou know, the nests look like cages.\nAnyway...\nthe whole way home I thought I wouldn't be able to fight this any more.\nSo when we got near the house, we were about to park and Andrew said to me, \"Do you want to go to the movies or stay home?\" I said...\nI said yes.\nAnd he says, \"Yes, the movies?\" And I said, \"Yes, home. I'll marry you.\n\"Yes.\" I mean, fuck it.\n\"Fuck, I'll marry you, yes.\" Mm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo where do you think this, um...\n\"Fuck it, yes,\" came from?\nI mean, everything that you've been saying to Andrew, everything you've been doing for the past few weeks has been one big no.\n\n**Patient:**\nI mean, what, you think Andrew took me there as some sort of object lesson?\nTo show me how good it could be for us? Cos I don't think so.\nAndrew's a pretty mediocre psychologist.\nWould you listen to me? I'm already bad-mouthing my future husband.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou didn't answer my question, Laura.\nWhere did this yes come from?\n\n**Patient:**\nYou really don't understand why I said yes to him?\nIt was because you said no to me.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause... Because I said no to you?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe whole situation is just one big fucking no.\nI'm not blaming you or accusing you, I'm just...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDid you expect a different reaction?\nIn your...\nfantasy...\nhow would I respond to you saying that you are, let's say, \"in love with me\"?\n\n**Patient:**\nFirst of all, take the quotation marks off the \"in love with me\".\nIt's insulting.\nAnd stop with the fantasy talk because fantasies are for silly little girls.\nWe're talking about reality, which is that I'm in love with you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBut I still...\n\n**Patient:**\nThat's reality.\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

It's not like there's time in the day to be surfing the net, this was a moment, I got away.\nThere's a lot of stuff to keep me busy.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat kind of stuff?\n\n**Patient:**\nMission review, aerial photos, videos. Just data, stuff.\nPreparation versus execution.\nEvery tiny technical aspect of our flight is recorded and analysed by the man.\nThere's nowhere to hide. And that's the way it should be.\nIt's just stuff and more stuff.\nWhen my mother died, my father had a year's worth of stuff to deal with.\nLast will and testament, her office, garden, a lifetime of photo albums.\nAnd every time I talked to him, I'd ask how he was, expecting, uh...\nyou know, that... he'd break down.\nFinally.\n\"It never ends, Alex, it never ends.

There is no comparison.\nAnyway, look, that's over and I'm back now at my home base and now I'm on R&R.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat kind of things do you do for R&R?\n\n**Patient:**\nDon't try to get ahead of me.\nI'm a runner.

It gets, uh...\nIt gets stuck. Hi. I'm your therapist.\n\n**Patient:**\nSophie.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNice to meet you. Come on in.\n\n**Patient:**\nHere?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nDo you need any help with the...\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. It's OK.\nAnna Colden recommended that I talk to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnna Colden?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe's my lawyer. She heard about you from a friend of yours.\nI mean, a friend of hers, not a friend of yours.\nFrom a patient of yours who is a friend of hers. Sorry.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMm. So, Anna Colden recommended you through a patient.\n\n**Patient:**\nDo you know his name?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI don't know.\nSo what did Anna recommend me for?\n\n**Patient:**\nAfter my accident... I told you on the phone about the accident?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\n\n**Patient:**\nThey told me I need the opinion of a psychiatrist because the insurance company of the car that hit me has a problem with my injuries or...\nsomething like that. So that's why I'm here.\nI'm here for your professional opinion, not for...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNot for... Not for therapy?\nSo, let's see if I'm, uh... if I'm getting this right.\nAre you suing the insurance company of the person who hit you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Their insurance company had me talk to a social worker.\nAnd... she started asking me all sorts of annoying questions.\nShe was really annoying so I refused to talk to her.\nShe started talking to me like she knew me, so I refused to talk and that didn't go over so well, so my mother said it would be better if I came to talk to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nRight. So what happened at the accident that requires a psychiatric opinion?\n\n**Patient:**\nI really don't remember what happened.\nI was on my bicycle and a car ran into me and I don't remember what happened next.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat did they tell you afterwards?\n\n**Patient:**\nThat I flew my bike right into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're... You're laughing at that.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat that sounds like, flying straight into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you find that funny, yeah?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause it reminds me of something about two years ago.\nA... A friend of mine, he took me out on this motorbike and he stopped to get something at a convenience store.\nAnyway, I was really bored so I pretended that I knew how to drive it.\nYou put your hands on the handlebars and go like this.\nWell, it was one of those monster bikes.\nJust by turning the handle a little, it just flies.\nSo, suddenly, I'm like, zoom, and it takes off.\nMy head, it whips back like this and when I look down, I realise I'm riding into the street.\nTotally crashed into a car.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nThere was this old woman standing nearby and she saw all this. \"I saw her. She did it on purpose.\n\"She tried to kill herself. She tried to kill herself.\" That's what she was yelling?\nYeah, she was like a crazy woman.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\nCourse, it couldn't have been that funny when it happened, I'm sure?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Not really.\nI wanted to kill her. I was just lying there.\nI couldn't move. I couldn't do anything.\nI wanted to yell, \"Shut up, you... you idiot.\n\"Why are you screaming?\" You know? But I couldn't speak.\nIt's like this feeling...\nwhen somebody says something about you and you can't defend yourself.\nIt's totally unfair.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLike that social worker you were talking about.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat does she have to do with it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, didn't you feel that she was speaking for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, but I could have said something.\nI just didn't want to.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHm.\nSo, tell me a little more about this, uh, this accident.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's all in that report.\n\nWhere did it happen?\n\n**Patient:**\nIn a gas station on Madison near the gym where I train.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you were on the way to the gym?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. I told you I don't remember anything.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you feel comfortable talking about yourself, Sophie?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nMy name is Sophie. I'm 16 years old.\nI've been a gymnast since the age of six and a half.\nI was US junior champion at the age of 12.\nI'm an only child.\nI don't know. What do you wanna know?\nIn another few months are the national trials.\nLast chance to qualify for the Olympics.\nI'm kind of like... an Olympic hopeful.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWow.\nThat's really impressive. Congratulations.\n\n**Patient:**\nThank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo how is life in general?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, apart from the gymnastics.\nHow's life?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's great.\nI just don't have the energy for This Is Your Life right now.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThis Is Your Life? What do... What do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nYou know, like the TV show.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're way too young to know about that show.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's on DVD. My mom's friend watches it all the time.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you think of it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's OK.\nSome of the people on it are so old.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n Why do you think they put old people on that?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Cos they have nothing better to do?\nThey're retired and dying off fast so they put them on the show before it's too late.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo do you think you can help me with this professional opinion or not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's not that simple, Sophie.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause it's not like an X-ray where you can take photographs, look at the results and then you go on your way.\nIt doesn't quite work like that.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nOK, so I guess I'll leave.\nWould you at least like to read what it says in the report?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIf you want me to.\n\n**Patient:**\nLike you already know what it says?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. I've no idea what it says.\n\n**Patient:**\nListen, I didn't come here to talk about myself.\nI just need your opinion.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you want me to give you my opinion based on what I read and the conversation that we've had today, is that it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIs that a problem?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. No.\nI'll write up an opinion and, um...\nwhen you come next week, you can decide whether you want to use it or not.\n\n**Patient:**\nJust like that, without any more questions?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, what kind of questions do you want me to ask?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Shrink-like questions.\nSay, about Mom, Dad, that kind of thing?\nDoesn't sound like you're interested.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy would you say that, Sophie?\nI am very interested in everything that you have to say.\nI mean that.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou spoke to my mother already, didn't you?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI didn't.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou already know what it says in there.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI've never spoken to her.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou did and you're letting me sit here and you know exactly what's in that envelope.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWas I... Was I supposed to talk to her?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat, did you, like, plan everything?\nLike I'm some kind of idiot, you planned some charade?\nWhat's the point? Whatever. She would send me to someone like you.\nI should have listened to my father. He called them a cult of crazies.\nOpen the door for me, please.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd if I did speak to your mom?\n\n**Patient:**\nI knew it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, then?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt means you're a liar, OK?\nCos I know how it's supposed to work.\nYou're supposed to read that report and ask the stupid shrink questions you ask.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoesn't it seems unprofessional to so not do it that way?\nMaybe I have something to say about what it says in there.\nI just wanted to read the report by myself before our meeting next week. That's all.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat meeting next week?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'd like us to meet three or four times for me to form an opinion of you, to get to know you a little.\nDon't you think?\nOtherwise... it wouldn't be professional.\nHm?\nI'll read it now.\nOK?\nSo are all these ships instead of sailing for real?\n\n**Patient:**\nUh-huh.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAt least you won't get seasick.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh...\nI don't know about that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nSometimes I can get quite wobbly just sitting right here.\nYou have to make a round window to the outside.\nThen you'll feel like you're in a real ship.\nDid you really read all those books or is it just to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUh-huh.\n\n**Patient:**\nYes, you read them or yes, you're trying to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nI've read them.\nI feel sorry for the books up there.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh. Why do you feel sorry for them?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhere would you put them?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. They're your fucking books.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou suffer from asthma.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. How do you know that?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThere's an inhaler here.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, thanks. I've been looking everywhere for that. Thank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, you could have died without it?\nAccording to what it says here...\nit looks like you could have died too.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah.

So don't.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nJoy is a very rare thing when it comes to me.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'm...\nI'm just wondering if you came here today determined to, uh...\ndemonstrate that joy, especially after last week's events.\nI'm asking myself if this isn't a bit too fast, if you haven't perhaps taken a short cut.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou think that I'm faking this?

I just, um...\nI know it's silly but...\nbeforehand when you said your...\nyour lungs could explode, it was just the thought that something might happen to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYet you're the one who ascended so fast.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou know what, Doctor? I don't want a depressing session.\nI want a happy session.

Why is he calling me here?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMaybe he's worried. You were out all night.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, right. If he really cared, he wouldn't have started with this shit.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nStart what?\n\n**Patient:**\nAt the club with this guy...\nOh, my God.\nHe had corduroy pants on, preppy sweater.\nRepublican probably.\n  Can I just step out for a second and let him know I'm here?\nI can't concentrate with this shit.\nJust a sec.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLaura, the call can wait.\n\n**Patient:**\n Andrew gave me an ultimatum.\nEither we get married or we split.\nSaid he wants an answer in a day or two at the most, or else he's out.\nSaid he can't take it any more.\nThat he loves me, that he doesn't believe I love him, not for real.\nThat it's been two years already, on and off, blah, blah, blah.\nI don't know why. All of a sudden, he just started ranting and raving.\nWe've talked about this stuff before, but it was all in theory if we stayed together, if.\nAnd suddenly out of the blue, I can't even remember what we were doing...\nWe were watching TV.\nAll of a sudden he just gets off the couch, grabs the remote and turns off the TV, and he turns to me and he has tears in his eyes and he says, \"That's it, I can't take it any more.\" So out of line. He promised he'd lay off the subject for a while.\nAnd all of a sudden he's on this crying bullshit.\nHe actually burst out crying. I've never seen him like that before.\nAnd to tell you the truth it really scared me.\nNo, it made me angry.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy?\n\n**Patient:**\nHe's trying to manipulate me with these cheap chick tricks.\nMaybe he thought he would break my heart or something.\nOr appeal to my...\nShit, you know, forget it, I don't know.\nI threw a tantrum like a three-year-old.\nI screamed, cried...\ntold him to fuck off...\ntold him he was a little piece of shit for doing this to me when he knows I'm working double shifts at the hospital this week.\nI slammed the door, smashed his laptop on the floor, I killed it, I ran out and I called Ilona.\nShe dressed me in this outfit.\nIt's, it's not mine.\nWe went out for a drink at a club that she likes on Chester Street.\nShe tried to calm me down, put things into perspective.\nAnd she said...\nShe said that I was lucky...\nthat she wished somebody had loved her enough to give her an ultimatum.\nAnd then we drank. Well, I drank.\nAnd there's this guy at the bar, and at some point Ilona said that she was tired and that she needed to go home.\nAnd then that guy...\nmoved next to me, and, erm...\nYou know what he said?\nHe said, \"You look so sad.\" And I said, \"Really?\" And he said, \"Yeah, you do. It looks good on you.\" \"Looks good on you.\" Whatever happened to, \"Do you have the time?\" or, \"Haven't we met before?\" I must be totally out of touch, Doctor.\nWhat do you think? I mean, do I look good when I'm sad?\nI don't think anybody looks good when they're sad.\nAnd then, er, I don't know how much I had to drink cos he was ordering for me, of course, and then he paid the bill and he asked me, \"Would you like to go somewhere else?\" And I said, \"Yes, I'd like to go to the bathroom.\" So I stood up and I went to the bathroom, he follows me.\nAnd you wouldn't believe it but these were unisex bathrooms.\nAm I unlucky or what?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow do you mean, unlucky?\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, I'm running away from a guy and I'm...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou were trying to get away from the guy.\n\n**Patient:**\nI mean, I needed to pee, by myself, I've been doing that since I was three.\nSo I realise I needed to make a decision.\nBy following me to the bathroom, this guy was also giving me an ultimatum.\nI thought, \"Fuck, out of the pan and into the fire.\" I ran away from one ultimatum, and there was this guy with a hard on giving me another.\nSuddenly I felt like doing it.\nI never had sex in a bathroom before.\nI mean, what, I should go and marry Andrew without ever knowing what a good bathroom fuck's all about?\nIt's part of a young lady's education, isn't it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you wanted to do it but not to get back at Andrew, just for yourself?\n\n**Patient:**\nThat's right.\nA girl being forced into marriage...\nwhat's she supposed to do, die ignorant?\nSo this guy follows me into the stall and...\nsuddenly...\nI was horny.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs hearing about this disgusting to you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. It's not disgusting.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nGo on.\n\n**Patient:**\nHe unzipped, pulled down his pants, and he stood there with this...\nhuge...\nOh, God, I felt like I was 16...\ntouching it for the very first time.\nI was really surprised at how...\nwarm it felt.\nI mean, don't I know that already?\nAnd then he turned me round to face the door...\nand he pulled down my stockings.\nHe lifted up my skirt, put his hand into his back pocket and pulled out a condom.\nI realise this guy's very good at this, he does this a lot, he's a real pro.\nAnd then this guy entered the stall next to us and started peeing, and gushes full volume like a racehorse.\nAnd I thought of Andrew...\nhow... how he pees in the morning, making the same sound.\nMy heart ached, I just...\nIt was so stupid, you know, I just felt so sad all of a sudden, and then he's behind me and he's rubbing up against me and he's feeling me up.\nAnd I thought to myself, \"It's gonna happen any moment now,\" and I just...\nI just couldn't do it.\nI simply closed my legs shut. I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it to Andrew.\nI just couldn't do it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, seems like quite a night out.\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, yeah, that's not the end of it, because this idiot, I told him, \"I'm really sorry but I have a boyfriend, I can't do this.\" And he says, \"Boo-hoo,\" and he grabs my hands and he says, \"Listen, cupcake, you think you can leave me high and dry like this?\" Pointing at his dick.\n\"The least you can do is make it up to me.\" I said to him, \"What do you want? You want some money?\" He said, \"Give me a hand job \"and there'll be no hard feelings.\" And I said to him, \"What's the matter with you? Are you crazy?\" And it was just getting really strange. It was tense. His tone changed.\nAnd then...\nAnd then I thought of you.\nWhat you'd say about it.\nI thought about us going through this in therapy.\nAnd what did you imagine us saying?\nI imagined you not being able to understand it.\nThat you'd be disgusted.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs that why you ran over here?\nTo find out if I would be disgusted?\n\n**Patient:**\nI didn't run.\nI gave him the hand job.\nGod. Excuse me.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n You OK?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. Yeah, I'm fine.\n Yeah.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThank you.\n\n**Patient:**\nWe, erm...\nWe talked about what happened at the, er, the club last night but we never got back to actually talking about Andrew and that argument yesterday.\nI don't wanna be put in this position.\nI don't wanna have this power to decide our future for both of us. I just don't.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you have any idea why Andrew chose this particular time?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat do you mean?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you think that Andrew, just out of the blue, as you said yourself, came up with this idea of an ultimatum?\nDid you notice anything over the last couple of days or weeks that you think might have brought this on?\n\n**Patient:**\nNothing, I don't know. He just lost it.\nShit, don't you know that men are the new women?\nObsessed with weddings and children. And lately he's lost touch with reality.\nHe thinks I'm seeing someone. That's how this whole thing started. It's unbelievable.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI thought you said it came out of nowhere.\nYou were watching TV and then suddenly...\n\n**Patient:**\nWe were watching TV but, before that, we were having dinner and he had this look on his face, this sad look, and I could tell something was up. You can just tell, right?\nAnd I said to him, \"What's going on?\" And he said, \"I don't know what I want, \"I just know I don't want this on-and-off thing.\" So I said to him, \"Sure.\" And then, \"Let's just decide, either we get married or we split.\"\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you were the one who came up with it.\n\n**Patient:**\nWith what?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe ultimatum.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, he's the one.\nHe had the problem with the on-and-off thing.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYeah, but on and off can mean several things.\nYou were the one who made it specific get married or to split up, that was your ultimatum.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, no, no, he had this thing with this on and o...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe ultim...\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, OK. I was the first one to say it, you're right.\nBut he jumped all over it. I said I didn't know what I want and he said, \"You have a day or two max to decide what you want.\" And I said, \"Fine.\" And then he started crying and blah, blah, blah.\nThe whole thing was scary to him, I think.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat about you?

I came this close to knocking on your door and asking for a sweater.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhen was that?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know, maybe five or six.\nI can't remember. It was still dark.\nWaited for the sun to come up.\nI never waited this long for a sunrise, except maybe on a camping trip in fifth grade.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThank you.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou know what I did?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat?\n\n**Patient:**\nI held my cellphone and I watched the minutes go by.\nIt felt like forever for one minute to turn into the next.\nI thought to myself, \"How stupid is this?\n\"Dying on a street like roadkill outside your therapist's office.\" I'm sorry, Doctor, I...\nI should have called it off. I shouldn't have come.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou should have come here.\nWhat happened last night?\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, what didn't happen?\nWant the long version or the bottom line?\nBecause the bottom line's very simple.\nMy life is over.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThen you'd better tell me the long version.\n\n**Patient:**\nI left Andrew. We had a big blowout screaming, crying, the works.\nThen at some point, I called Ilona, and we went out for a drink, and...\nwe had a few drinks.\nListen, I'm not here. I'm so totally not here.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou are very much here, Laura.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, it's not me that's here.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBelieve me, you'd be shocked to know the person that's sitting here.\n\n**Patient:**\nDid some...\nI did some terrible things last night.\n I feel sick.\nI don't wanna throw up.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoesn't matter, it's no big deal.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat do you mean?\nIt's vomit. I'm not gonna vomit all over your rug.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's a cheap rug, Laura.\nLet's talk about what's really going on here.\nHm?\n\n**Patient:**\n  It's Andrew. He knows I'm here at this time. Why is he calling me here?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMaybe he's worried. You were out all night.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, right. If he really cared, he wouldn't have started with this shit.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nStart what?\n\n**Patient:**\nAt the club with this guy...\nOh, my God.\nHe had corduroy pants on, preppy sweater.\nRepublican probably.\n  Can I just step out for a second and let him know I'm here?\nI can't concentrate with this shit.\nJust a sec.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLaura, the call can wait.\n\n**Patient:**\n Andrew gave me an ultimatum.\nEither we get married or we split.\nSaid he wants an answer in a day or two at the most, or else he's out.\nSaid he can't take it any more.\nThat he loves me, that he doesn't believe I love him, not for real.\nThat it's been two years already, on and off, blah, blah, blah.\nI don't know why. All of a sudden, he just started ranting and raving.\nWe've talked about this stuff before, but it was all in theory if we stayed together, if.\nAnd suddenly out of the blue, I can't even remember what we were doing...\nWe were watching TV.\nAll of a sudden he just gets off the couch, grabs the remote and turns off the TV, and he turns to me and he has tears in his eyes and he says, \"That's it, I can't take it any more.\" So out of line. He promised he'd lay off the subject for a while.\nAnd all of a sudden he's on this crying bullshit.\nHe actually burst out crying. I've never seen him like that before.\nAnd to tell you the truth it really scared me.\nNo, it made me angry.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy?\n\n**Patient:**\nHe's trying to manipulate me with these cheap chick tricks.\nMaybe he thought he would break my heart or something.\nOr appeal to my...\nShit, you know, forget it, I don't know.\nI threw a tantrum like a three-year-old.\nI screamed, cried...\ntold him to fuck off...\ntold him he was a little piece of shit for doing this to me when he knows I'm working double shifts at the hospital this week.\nI slammed the door, smashed his laptop on the floor, I killed it, I ran out and I called Ilona.\nShe dressed me in this outfit.\nIt's, it's not mine.\nWe went out for a drink at a club that she likes on Chester Street.\nShe tried to calm me down, put things into perspective.\nAnd she said...\nShe said that I was lucky...\nthat she wished somebody had loved her enough to give her an ultimatum.\nAnd then we drank. Well, I drank.\nAnd there's this guy at the bar, and at some point Ilona said that she was tired and that she needed to go home.\nAnd then that guy...\nmoved next to me, and, erm...\nYou know what he said?\nHe said, \"You look so sad.\" And I said, \"Really?\" And he said, \"Yeah, you do. It looks good on you.\" \"Looks good on you.\" Whatever happened to, \"Do you have the time?\" or, \"Haven't we met before?\" I must be totally out of touch, Doctor.\nWhat do you think? I mean, do I look good when I'm sad?\nI don't think anybody looks good when they're sad.\nAnd then, er, I don't know how much I had to drink cos he was ordering for me, of course, and then he paid the bill and he asked me, \"Would you like to go somewhere else?\" And I said, \"Yes, I'd like to go to the bathroom.\" So I stood up and I went to the bathroom, he follows me.\nAnd you wouldn't believe it but these were unisex bathrooms.\nAm I unlucky or what?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow do you mean, unlucky?\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, I'm running away from a guy and I'm...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou were trying to get away from the guy.\n\n**Patient:**\nI mean, I needed to pee, by myself, I've been doing that since I was three.\nSo I realise I needed to make a decision.\nBy following me to the bathroom, this guy was also giving me an ultimatum.\nI thought, \"Fuck, out of the pan and into the fire.\" I ran away from one ultimatum, and there was this guy with a hard on giving me another.\nSuddenly I felt like doing it.\nI never had sex in a bathroom before.\nI mean, what, I should go and marry Andrew without ever knowing what a good bathroom fuck's all about?\nIt's part of a young lady's education, isn't it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you wanted to do it but not to get back at Andrew, just for yourself?\n\n**Patient:**\nThat's right.\nA girl being forced into marriage...\nwhat's she supposed to do, die ignorant?\nSo this guy follows me into the stall and...\nsuddenly...\nI was horny.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs hearing about this disgusting to you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. It's not disgusting.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nGo on.\n\n**Patient:**\nHe unzipped, pulled down his pants, and he stood there with this...\nhuge...\nOh, God, I felt like I was 16...\ntouching it for the very first time.\nI was really surprised at how...\nwarm it felt.\nI mean, don't I know that already?\nAnd then he turned me round to face the door...\nand he pulled down my stockings.\nHe lifted up my skirt, put his hand into his back pocket and pulled out a condom.\nI realise this guy's very good at this, he does this a lot, he's a real pro.\nAnd then this guy entered the stall next to us and started peeing, and gushes full volume like a racehorse.\nAnd I thought of Andrew...\nhow... how he pees in the morning, making the same sound.\nMy heart ached, I just...\nIt was so stupid, you know, I just felt so sad all of a sudden, and then he's behind me and he's rubbing up against me and he's feeling me up.\nAnd I thought to myself, \"It's gonna happen any moment now,\" and I just...\nI just couldn't do it.\nI simply closed my legs shut. I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it to Andrew.\nI just couldn't do it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, seems like quite a night out.\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, yeah, that's not the end of it, because this idiot, I told him, \"I'm really sorry but I have a boyfriend, I can't do this.\" And he says, \"Boo-hoo,\" and he grabs my hands and he says, \"Listen, cupcake, you think you can leave me high and dry like this?\" Pointing at his dick.\n\"The least you can do is make it up to me.\" I said to him, \"What do you want? You want some money?\" He said, \"Give me a hand job \"and there'll be no hard feelings.\" And I said to him, \"What's the matter with you? Are you crazy?\" And it was just getting really strange. It was tense. His tone changed.\nAnd then...\nAnd then I thought of you.\nWhat you'd say about it.\nI thought about us going through this in therapy.\nAnd what did you imagine us saying?\nI imagined you not being able to understand it.\nThat you'd be disgusted.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs that why you ran over here?\nTo find out if I would be disgusted?\n\n**Patient:**\nI didn't run.\nI gave him the hand job.\nGod. Excuse me.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n You OK?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. Yeah, I'm fine.\n Yeah.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThank you.\n\n**Patient:**\nWe, erm...\nWe talked about what happened at the, er, the club last night but we never got back to actually talking about Andrew and that argument yesterday.\nI don't wanna be put in this position.\nI don't wanna have this power to decide our future for both of us. I just don't.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you have any idea why Andrew chose this particular time?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat do you mean?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you think that Andrew, just out of the blue, as you said yourself, came up with this idea of an ultimatum?\nDid you notice anything over the last couple of days or weeks that you think might have brought this on?\n\n**Patient:**\nNothing, I don't know. He just lost it.\nShit, don't you know that men are the new women?\nObsessed with weddings and children. And lately he's lost touch with reality.\nHe thinks I'm seeing someone. That's how this whole thing started. It's unbelievable.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI thought you said it came out of nowhere.\nYou were watching TV and then suddenly...\n\n**Patient:**\nWe were watching TV but, before that, we were having dinner and he had this look on his face, this sad look, and I could tell something was up. You can just tell, right?\nAnd I said to him, \"What's going on?\" And he said, \"I don't know what I want, \"I just know I don't want this on-and-off thing.\" So I said to him, \"Sure.\" And then, \"Let's just decide, either we get married or we split.\"\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you were the one who came up with it.\n\n**Patient:**\nWith what?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe ultimatum.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, he's the one.\nHe had the problem with the on-and-off thing.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYeah, but on and off can mean several things.\nYou were the one who made it specific get married or to split up, that was your ultimatum.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, no, no, he had this thing with this on and o...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe ultim...\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, OK. I was the first one to say it, you're right.\nBut he jumped all over it. I said I didn't know what I want and he said, \"You have a day or two max to decide what you want.\" And I said, \"Fine.\" And then he started crying and blah, blah, blah.\nThe whole thing was scary to him, I think.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat about you? Weren't you scared?\n\n**Patient:**\nOf what?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOf splitting up.\n\n**Patient:**\nI wasn't suggesting that we split up. That's not the point.\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy. You are feeling neutral.\nNow, you will make the patient feel at ease.

Not for therapy?\nSo, let's see if I'm, uh... if I'm getting this right.\nAre you suing the insurance company of the person who hit you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Their insurance company had me talk to a social worker.\nAnd... she started asking me all sorts of annoying questions.\nShe was really annoying so I refused to talk to her.\nShe started talking to me like she knew me, so I refused to talk and that didn't go over so well, so my mother said it would be better if I came to talk to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nRight.

We had a big blowout screaming, crying, the works.\nThen at some point, I called Ilona, and we went out for a drink, and...\nwe had a few drinks.\nListen, I'm not here. I'm so totally not here.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou are very much here, Laura.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, it's not me that's here.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBelieve me, you'd be shocked to know the person that's sitting here.\n\n**Patient:**\nDid some...\nI did some terrible things last night.\n I feel sick.\nI don't wanna throw up.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoesn't matter, it's no big deal.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat do you mean?\nIt's vomit. I'm not gonna vomit all over your rug.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's a cheap rug, Laura.\nLet's talk about what's really going on here.\nHm?\n\n**Patient:**\n  It's Andrew. He knows I'm here at this time. Why is he calling me here?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMaybe he's worried. You were out all night.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, right. If he really cared, he wouldn't have started with this shit.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nStart what?\n\n**Patient:**\nAt the club with this guy...\nOh, my God.\nHe had corduroy pants on, preppy sweater.\nRepublican probably.\n  Can I just step out for a second and let him know I'm here?\nI can't concentrate with this shit.\nJust a sec.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLaura, the call can wait.\n\n**Patient:**\n Andrew gave me an ultimatum.\nEither we get married or we split.\nSaid he wants an answer in a day or two at the most, or else he's out.\nSaid he can't take it any more.\nThat he loves me, that he doesn't believe I love him, not for real.\nThat it's been two years already, on and off, blah, blah, blah.\nI don't know why. All of a sudden, he just started ranting and raving.\nWe've talked about this stuff before, but it was all in theory if we stayed together, if.\nAnd suddenly out of the blue, I can't even remember what we were doing...\nWe were watching TV.\nAll of a sudden he just gets off the couch, grabs the remote and turns off the TV, and he turns to me and he has tears in his eyes and he says, \"That's it, I can't take it any more.\" So out of line. He promised he'd lay off the subject for a while.\nAnd all of a sudden he's on this crying bullshit.\nHe actually burst out crying. I've never seen him like that before.\nAnd to tell you the truth it really scared me.\nNo, it made me angry.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy?\n\n**Patient:**\nHe's trying to manipulate me with these cheap chick tricks.\nMaybe he thought he would break my heart or something.\nOr appeal to my...\nShit, you know, forget it, I don't know.\nI threw a tantrum like a three-year-old.\nI screamed, cried...\ntold him to fuck off...\ntold him he was a little piece of shit for doing this to me when he knows I'm working double shifts at the hospital this week.\nI slammed the door, smashed his laptop on the floor, I killed it, I ran out and I called Ilona.\nShe dressed me in this outfit.\nIt's, it's not mine.\nWe went out for a drink at a club that she likes on Chester Street.\nShe tried to calm me down, put things into perspective.\nAnd she said...\nShe said that I was lucky...\nthat she wished somebody had loved her enough to give her an ultimatum.\nAnd then we drank. Well, I drank.\nAnd there's this guy at the bar, and at some point Ilona said that she was tired and that she needed to go home.\nAnd then that guy...\nmoved next to me, and, erm...\nYou know what he said?\nHe said, \"You look so sad.\" And I said, \"Really?\" And he said, \"Yeah, you do. It looks good on you.\" \"Looks good on you.\" Whatever happened to, \"Do you have the time?\" or, \"Haven't we met before?\" I must be totally out of touch, Doctor.\nWhat do you think? I mean, do I look good when I'm sad?\nI don't think anybody looks good when they're sad.\nAnd then, er, I don't know how much I had to drink cos he was ordering for me, of course, and then he paid the bill and he asked me, \"Would you like to go somewhere else?\" And I said, \"Yes, I'd like to go to the bathroom.\" So I stood up and I went to the bathroom, he follows me.\nAnd you wouldn't believe it but these were unisex bathrooms.\nAm I unlucky or what?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow do you mean, unlucky?\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, I'm running away from a guy and I'm...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou were trying to get away from the guy.\n\n**Patient:**\nI mean, I needed to pee, by myself, I've been doing that since I was three.\nSo I realise I needed to make a decision.\nBy following me to the bathroom, this guy was also giving me an ultimatum.\nI thought, \"Fuck, out of the pan and into the fire.\" I ran away from one ultimatum, and there was this guy with a hard on giving me another.\nSuddenly I felt like doing it.\nI never had sex in a bathroom before.\nI mean, what, I should go and marry Andrew without ever knowing what a good bathroom fuck's all about?\nIt's part of a young lady's education, isn't it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you wanted to do it but not to get back at Andrew, just for yourself?\n\n**Patient:**\nThat's right.\nA girl being forced into marriage...\nwhat's she supposed to do, die ignorant?\nSo this guy follows me into the stall and...\nsuddenly...\nI was horny.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs hearing about this disgusting to you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. It's not disgusting.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nGo on.\n\n**Patient:**\nHe unzipped, pulled down his pants, and he stood there with this...\nhuge...\nOh, God, I felt like I was 16...\ntouching it for the very first time.\nI was really surprised at how...\nwarm it felt.\nI mean, don't I know that already?\nAnd then he turned me round to face the door...\nand he pulled down my stockings.\nHe lifted up my skirt, put his hand into his back pocket and pulled out a condom.\nI realise this guy's very good at this, he does this a lot, he's a real pro.\nAnd then this guy entered the stall next to us and started peeing, and gushes full volume like a racehorse.\nAnd I thought of Andrew...\nhow... how he pees in the morning, making the same sound.\nMy heart ached, I just...\nIt was so stupid, you know, I just felt so sad all of a sudden, and then he's behind me and he's rubbing up against me and he's feeling me up.\nAnd I thought to myself, \"It's gonna happen any moment now,\" and I just...\nI just couldn't do it.\nI simply closed my legs shut. I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it to Andrew.\nI just couldn't do it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, seems like quite a night out.\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, yeah, that's not the end of it, because this idiot, I told him, \"I'm really sorry but I have a boyfriend, I can't do this.\" And he says, \"Boo-hoo,\" and he grabs my hands and he says, \"Listen, cupcake, you think you can leave me high and dry like this?\" Pointing at his dick.\n\"The least you can do is make it up to me.\" I said to him, \"What do you want? You want some money?\" He said, \"Give me a hand job \"and there'll be no hard feelings.\" And I said to him, \"What's the matter with you? Are you crazy?\" And it was just getting really strange. It was tense. His tone changed.\nAnd then...\nAnd then I thought of you.\nWhat you'd say about it.\nI thought about us going through this in therapy.\nAnd what did you imagine us saying?\nI imagined you not being able to understand it.\nThat you'd be disgusted.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs that why you ran over here?\nTo find out if I would be disgusted?\n\n**Patient:**\nI didn't run.\nI gave him the hand job.\nGod. Excuse me.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n You OK?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. Yeah, I'm fine.\n Yeah.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThank you.\n\n**Patient:**\nWe, erm...\nWe talked about what happened at the, er, the club last night but we never got back to actually talking about Andrew and that argument yesterday.\nI don't wanna be put in this position.\nI don't wanna have this power to decide our future for both of us. I just don't.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you have any idea why Andrew chose this particular time?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat do you mean?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you think that Andrew, just out of the blue, as you said yourself, came up with this idea of an ultimatum?\nDid you notice anything over the last couple of days or weeks that you think might have brought this on?\n\n**Patient:**\nNothing, I don't know. He just lost it.\nShit, don't you know that men are the new women?\nObsessed with weddings and children. And lately he's lost touch with reality.\nHe thinks I'm seeing someone. That's how this whole thing started. It's unbelievable.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI thought you said it came out of nowhere.\nYou were watching TV and then suddenly...\n\n**Patient:**\nWe were watching TV but, before that, we were having dinner and he had this look on his face, this sad look, and I could tell something was up. You can just tell, right?\nAnd I said to him, \"What's going on?\" And he said, \"I don't know what I want, \"I just know I don't want this on-and-off thing.\" So I said to him, \"Sure.\" And then, \"Let's just decide, either we get married or we split.\"\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you were the one who came up with it.\n\n**Patient:**\nWith what?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe ultimatum.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, he's the one.\nHe had the problem with the on-and-off thing.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYeah, but on and off can mean several things.\nYou were the one who made it specific get married or to split up, that was your ultimatum.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, no, no, he had this thing with this on and o...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe ultim...\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, OK. I was the first one to say it, you're right.\nBut he jumped all over it. I said I didn't know what I want and he said, \"You have a day or two max to decide what you want.\" And I said, \"Fine.\" And then he started crying and blah, blah, blah.\nThe whole thing was scary to him, I think.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat about you? Weren't you scared?\n\n**Patient:**\nOf what?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOf splitting up.\n\n**Patient:**\nI wasn't suggesting that we split up. That's not the point.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what do you think was the point of this argument that you may have initiated?\n\n**Patient:**\nI didn't initiate anything.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, you may not have meant to, but you did.\nIt sounds like you wanted to bring this relationship into crisis.\nI know you say that Andrew hates uncertainties but perhaps you're the one who can't live with them.\nWhy did you choose this particular time to bring things to a head?\n\n**Patient:**\nI did no such thing.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy now?\n\n**Patient:**\nCos he's right.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAndrew's right.\n\n**Patient:**\nI am being unfaithful to him.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou mean what happened last night at the club?\n\n**Patient:**\nNot just last night.\nI've been unfaithful to him for a long time.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo, why haven't we talked about this before?\n\n**Patient:**\nI think we have.\nIt's been here all along.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou mean to say you've never noticed it?\n\n**Patient:**\nYou're surprised.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, I'm not surprised, I just... I don't follow what you mean.\n\n**Patient:**\nThis isn't...\nthe reaction I was hoping for.\nNot at all.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat was the reaction that you were hoping for?\n\n**Patient:**\nI...\nI had two scenarios in my head.\nIn the first one, you stand up and you hug me...\nand you say, \"I love you.\n\"Love you too, Laura.\n\"I've been feeling this way for a long time, \"I just wanted you to be the first one to say it.\" And then we make love.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd the, erm...\nthe second scenario?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's like the first one but...\nbut without the sex, we just sit here together.\nYou know, I'm embarrassed to even talk about it.\nYou're sitting there like a fucking Buddha, acting like you have no idea what I'm talking about. It's humiliating.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow long have you felt like this?\n\n**Patient:**\nA year.\nFrom the first session.\nI thought it'd go away, I thought, \"It's just an infatuation, that's all.\" But it's getting worse.\nYou've become the centre of my life.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLaura...\nI'm your therapist.\nThe parameters and the limitations...\nare established and ethically defined.\nI'm not an option.\nYou may be using me as a...\nas an excuse to bail from your relationship with, with Andrew.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou know why I didn't fuck that guy?\nNot because of Andrew, not because I didn't wanna cheat on him, I do wanna cheat on him, but with you.\nWhen I was sitting there at the bar by myself, I was thinking, \"What would happen if you were to walk in?\" You'd walk in, you'd sit next to me at the bar, you'd order a drink.\nI even tried to imagine what you would order.\nA shot of bourbon, maybe, something expensive, something fancy.\nThen we'd start talking.\n\"What a coincidence it is to meet like this, \"how awkward it is to meet outside the office.\" And then, without words, because we talk enough when we're here...\nyou motion for me to follow you to the bathroom.\nAnd I do.\nWhen I went into the stall with that guy...\nI imagined it was you behind me.\nThat's what made it so exciting.\nThen that guy started peeing and it woke me up and I realised that it's impossible.\nI know it, I understand it. I tell myself that every time I walk out of here.\nI know it, I understand it but I'm not sure that my body understands it.\nI know it can never happen, I know.\nSo don't worry, I'm not gonna start showing up here, I'm not gonna start stalking you like...\nGlenn Close in that movie.\nI'm not gonna boil your kid's rabbit.\nI'm not dangerous.\nAt least not to you.\nGod, how can I go back to my life?\nTo the hospital, to Andrew.\nNot to Andrew when the only thing that matters to me is you.\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

I've never seen him like that before.\nAnd to tell you the truth it really scared me.\nNo, it made me angry.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy?\n\n**Patient:**\nHe's trying to manipulate me with these cheap chick tricks.\nMaybe he thought he would break my heart or something.\nOr appeal to my...\nShit, you know, forget it, I don't know.\nI threw a tantrum like a three-year-old.\nI screamed, cried...\ntold him to fuck off...\ntold him he was a little piece of shit for doing this to me when he knows I'm working double shifts at the hospital this week.\nI slammed the door, smashed his laptop on the floor, I killed it, I ran out and I called Ilona.\nShe dressed me in this outfit.\nIt's, it's not mine.\nWe went out for a drink at a club that she likes on Chester Street.\nShe tried to calm me down, put things into perspective.\nAnd she said...\nShe said that I was lucky...\nthat she wished somebody had loved her enough to give her an ultimatum.\nAnd then we drank. Well, I drank.\nAnd there's this guy at the bar, and at some point Ilona said that she was tired and that she needed to go home.\nAnd then that guy...\nmoved next to me, and, erm...\nYou know what he said?\nHe said, \"You look so sad.\" And I said, \"Really?\" And he said, \"Yeah, you do. It looks good on you.\" \"Looks good on you.\" Whatever happened to, \"Do you have the time?\" or, \"Haven't we met before?\" I must be totally out of touch, Doctor.\nWhat do you think? I mean, do I look good when I'm sad?\nI don't think anybody looks good when they're sad.\nAnd then, er, I don't know how much I had to drink cos he was ordering for me, of course, and then he paid the bill and he asked me, \"Would you like to go somewhere else?\" And I said, \"Yes, I'd like to go to the bathroom.\" So I stood up and I went to the bathroom, he follows me.\nAnd you wouldn't believe it but these were unisex bathrooms.\nAm I unlucky or what?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow do you mean, unlucky?\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, I'm running away from a guy and I'm...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou were trying to get away from the guy.\n\n**Patient:**\nI mean, I needed to pee, by myself, I've been doing that since I was three.\nSo I realise I needed to make a decision.\nBy following me to the bathroom, this guy was also giving me an ultimatum.\nI thought, \"Fuck, out of the pan and into the fire.\" I ran away from one ultimatum, and there was this guy with a hard on giving me another.\nSuddenly I felt like doing it.\nI never had sex in a bathroom before.\nI mean, what, I should go and marry Andrew without ever knowing what a good bathroom fuck's all about?\nIt's part of a young lady's education, isn't it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you wanted to do it but not to get back at Andrew, just for yourself?\n\n**Patient:**\nThat's right.\nA girl being forced into marriage...\nwhat's she supposed to do, die ignorant?\nSo this guy follows me into the stall and...\nsuddenly...\nI was horny.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs hearing about this disgusting to you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. It's not disgusting.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nGo on.\n\n**Patient:**\nHe unzipped, pulled down his pants, and he stood there with this...\nhuge...\nOh, God, I felt like I was 16...\ntouching it for the very first time.\nI was really surprised at how...\nwarm it felt.\nI mean, don't I know that already?\nAnd then he turned me round to face the door...\nand he pulled down my stockings.\nHe lifted up my skirt, put his hand into his back pocket and pulled out a condom.\nI realise this guy's very good at this, he does this a lot, he's a real pro.\nAnd then this guy entered the stall next to us and started peeing, and gushes full volume like a racehorse.\nAnd I thought of Andrew...\nhow... how he pees in the morning, making the same sound.\nMy heart ached, I just...\nIt was so stupid, you know, I just felt so sad all of a sudden, and then he's behind me and he's rubbing up against me and he's feeling me up.\nAnd I thought to myself, \"It's gonna happen any moment now,\" and I just...\nI just couldn't do it.\nI simply closed my legs shut. I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it to Andrew.\nI just couldn't do it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, seems like quite a night out.\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, yeah, that's not the end of it, because this idiot, I told him, \"I'm really sorry but I have a boyfriend, I can't do this.\" And he says, \"Boo-hoo,\" and he grabs my hands and he says, \"Listen, cupcake, you think you can leave me high and dry like this?\" Pointing at his dick.\n\"The least you can do is make it up to me.\" I said to him, \"What do you want? You want some money?\" He said, \"Give me a hand job \"and there'll be no hard feelings.\" And I said to him, \"What's the matter with you? Are you crazy?\" And it was just getting really strange. It was tense. His tone changed.\nAnd then...\nAnd then I thought of you.\nWhat you'd say about it.\nI thought about us going through this in therapy.\nAnd what did you imagine us saying?\nI imagined you not being able to understand it.\nThat you'd be disgusted.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs that why you ran over here?\nTo find out if I would be disgusted?\n\n**Patient:**\nI didn't run.\nI gave him the hand job.\nGod. Excuse me.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n You OK?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. Yeah, I'm fine.\n Yeah.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThank you.\n\n**Patient:**\nWe, erm...\nWe talked about what happened at the, er, the club last night but we never got back to actually talking about Andrew and that argument yesterday.\nI don't wanna be put in this position.\nI don't wanna have this power to decide our future for both of us. I just don't.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you have any idea why Andrew chose this particular time?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat do you mean?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you think that Andrew, just out of the blue, as you said yourself, came up with this idea of an ultimatum?\nDid you notice anything over the last couple of days or weeks that you think might have brought this on?\n\n**Patient:**\nNothing, I don't know. He just lost it.\nShit, don't you know that men are the new women?\nObsessed with weddings and children. And lately he's lost touch with reality.\nHe thinks I'm seeing someone. That's how this whole thing started. It's unbelievable.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI thought you said it came out of nowhere.\nYou were watching TV and then suddenly...\n\n**Patient:**\nWe were watching TV but, before that, we were having dinner and he had this look on his face, this sad look, and I could tell something was up. You can just tell, right?\nAnd I said to him, \"What's going on?\" And he said, \"I don't know what I want, \"I just know I don't want this on-and-off thing.\" So I said to him, \"Sure.\" And then, \"Let's just decide, either we get married or we split.\"\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you were the one who came up with it.\n\n**Patient:**\nWith what?\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

Come on in.\n\n**Patient:**\nHere?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nDo you need any help with the...\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. It's OK.\nAnna Colden recommended that I talk to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnna Colden?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe's my lawyer. She heard about you from a friend of yours.\nI mean, a friend of hers, not a friend of yours.\nFrom a patient of yours who is a friend of hers. Sorry.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMm. So, Anna Colden recommended you through a patient.\n\n**Patient:**\nDo you know his name?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI don't know.\nSo what did Anna recommend me for?\n\n**Patient:**\nAfter my accident... I told you on the phone about the accident?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\n\n**Patient:**\nThey told me I need the opinion of a psychiatrist because the insurance company of the car that hit me has a problem with my injuries or...\nsomething like that. So that's why I'm here.\nI'm here for your professional opinion, not for...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNot for... Not for therapy?\nSo, let's see if I'm, uh... if I'm getting this right.\nAre you suing the insurance company of the person who hit you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Their insurance company had me talk to a social worker.\nAnd... she started asking me all sorts of annoying questions.\nShe was really annoying so I refused to talk to her.\nShe started talking to me like she knew me, so I refused to talk and that didn't go over so well, so my mother said it would be better if I came to talk to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nRight. So what happened at the accident that requires a psychiatric opinion?\n\n**Patient:**\nI really don't remember what happened.\nI was on my bicycle and a car ran into me and I don't remember what happened next.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat did they tell you afterwards?\n\n**Patient:**\nThat I flew my bike right into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're... You're laughing at that.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat that sounds like, flying straight into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you find that funny, yeah?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause it reminds me of something about two years ago.\nA... A friend of mine, he took me out on this motorbike and he stopped to get something at a convenience store.\nAnyway, I was really bored so I pretended that I knew how to drive it.\nYou put your hands on the handlebars and go like this.\nWell, it was one of those monster bikes.\nJust by turning the handle a little, it just flies.\nSo, suddenly, I'm like, zoom, and it takes off.\nMy head, it whips back like this and when I look down, I realise I'm riding into the street.\nTotally crashed into a car.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nThere was this old woman standing nearby and she saw all this. \"I saw her. She did it on purpose.\n\"She tried to kill herself. She tried to kill herself.\" That's what she was yelling?\nYeah, she was like a crazy woman.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\nCourse, it couldn't have been that funny when it happened, I'm sure?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Not really.\nI wanted to kill her. I was just lying there.\nI couldn't move. I couldn't do anything.\nI wanted to yell, \"Shut up, you... you idiot.\n\"Why are you screaming?\" You know? But I couldn't speak.\nIt's like this feeling...\nwhen somebody says something about you and you can't defend yourself.\nIt's totally unfair.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLike that social worker you were talking about.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat does she have to do with it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, didn't you feel that she was speaking for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, but I could have said something.\nI just didn't want to.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHm.\nSo, tell me a little more about this, uh, this accident.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's all in that report.\n\nWhere did it happen?\n\n**Patient:**\nIn a gas station on Madison near the gym where I train.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you were on the way to the gym?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. I told you I don't remember anything.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you feel comfortable talking about yourself, Sophie?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nMy name is Sophie. I'm 16 years old.\nI've been a gymnast since the age of six and a half.\nI was US junior champion at the age of 12.\nI'm an only child.\nI don't know. What do you wanna know?\nIn another few months are the national trials.\nLast chance to qualify for the Olympics.\nI'm kind of like... an Olympic hopeful.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWow.\nThat's really impressive. Congratulations.\n\n**Patient:**\nThank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo how is life in general?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, apart from the gymnastics.\nHow's life?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's great.\nI just don't have the energy for This Is Your Life right now.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThis Is Your Life? What do... What do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nYou know, like the TV show.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're way too young to know about that show.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's on DVD. My mom's friend watches it all the time.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you think of it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's OK.\nSome of the people on it are so old.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n Why do you think they put old people on that?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Cos they have nothing better to do?\nThey're retired and dying off fast so they put them on the show before it's too late.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo do you think you can help me with this professional opinion or not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's not that simple, Sophie.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause it's not like an X-ray where you can take photographs, look at the results and then you go on your way.\nIt doesn't quite work like that.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nOK, so I guess I'll leave.\nWould you at least like to read what it says in the report?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIf you want me to.\n\n**Patient:**\nLike you already know what it says?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. I've no idea what it says.\n\n**Patient:**\nListen, I didn't come here to talk about myself.\nI just need your opinion.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you want me to give you my opinion based on what I read and the conversation that we've had today, is that it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIs that a problem?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. No.\nI'll write up an opinion and, um...\nwhen you come next week, you can decide whether you want to use it or not.\n\n**Patient:**\nJust like that, without any more questions?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, what kind of questions do you want me to ask?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Shrink-like questions.\nSay, about Mom, Dad, that kind of thing?\nDoesn't sound like you're interested.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy would you say that, Sophie?\nI am very interested in everything that you have to say.\nI mean that.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou spoke to my mother already, didn't you?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI didn't.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou already know what it says in there.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI've never spoken to her.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou did and you're letting me sit here and you know exactly what's in that envelope.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWas I... Was I supposed to talk to her?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat, did you, like, plan everything?\nLike I'm some kind of idiot, you planned some charade?\nWhat's the point? Whatever. She would send me to someone like you.\nI should have listened to my father. He called them a cult of crazies.\nOpen the door for me, please.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd if I did speak to your mom?\n\n**Patient:**\nI knew it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, then?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt means you're a liar, OK?\nCos I know how it's supposed to work.\nYou're supposed to read that report and ask the stupid shrink questions you ask.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoesn't it seems unprofessional to so not do it that way?\nMaybe I have something to say about what it says in there.\nI just wanted to read the report by myself before our meeting next week. That's all.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat meeting next week?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'd like us to meet three or four times for me to form an opinion of you, to get to know you a little.\nDon't you think?\nOtherwise... it wouldn't be professional.\nHm?\nI'll read it now.\nOK?\nSo are all these ships instead of sailing for real?\n\n**Patient:**\nUh-huh.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAt least you won't get seasick.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh...\nI don't know about that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nSometimes I can get quite wobbly just sitting right here.\nYou have to make a round window to the outside.\nThen you'll feel like you're in a real ship.\nDid you really read all those books or is it just to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUh-huh.\n\n**Patient:**\nYes, you read them or yes, you're trying to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nI've read them.\nI feel sorry for the books up there.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh. Why do you feel sorry for them?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhere would you put them?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. They're your fucking books.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou suffer from asthma.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. How do you know that?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThere's an inhaler here.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, thanks. I've been looking everywhere for that. Thank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, you could have died without it?\nAccording to what it says here...\nit looks like you could have died too.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. That would have solved a lot of problems.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat would it solve?\n\n**Patient:**\nNothing. I didn't mean anything by it.\nCan I talk to you like a normal person?\nDo you drive your daughter crazy with questions like this too?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMuch more crazy, believe me.\nHow d'you know I had a daughter?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause you do.\nYou know my mother.\nYou were on the PTA committee at Arlington elementary.\nI was there before I went off to a private school.\nI was in the same year as your daughter.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, why didn't you tell me that before?\n\n**Patient:**\nHm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou said that the, uh... that the social worker spoke to you like she knew you.\n\n**Patient:**\nShe was such a retard.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDid she ask you if, um... if you think about death a lot?\n\n**Patient:**\nHow did you know that?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAccording to what it says here, she was trying to prove that the accident was your fault.\nIt's a good thing you didn't answer any of her questions.\nBy the way, everybody thinks about death.\nI bet she didn't say that, though.\nDid she ask you if you had any specific thoughts about death?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you?\n\n**Patient:**\nDo I what?\nEveryone... Everyone thinks about death and, uh...\nimagines how it will come to them.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you have any more specific thoughts about it?\nI mean, maybe you have certain thoughts that you'd like to talk about.\n\n**Patient:**\nUnless you're worried about what I...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'm not worried.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nIs this how it's going to be for three appointments?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs this a little difficult for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nCan I have some water?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSure.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHang on a minute.\nSorry about this. It's for my little patients, the elves.\nIt's a bendy one.\nYou need help with that?\nMust be really hard to be, uh... be handicapped like that.\nWhat's the hardest thing about it?\n\n**Patient:**\nEveryone treats me like a baby.\nHm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDid you come here by yourself today?\n\n**Patient:**\nYes. By bus.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYour mom didn't offer to drive you?\nYeah, right. She knew there was no chance I'd say yes.\nBefore, when you got angry, when, uh...\nwhen you thought that she'd called me, I asked myself, \"Why didn't she call?\" It makes sense that she would call me first.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI don't... What do you mean?\nI'm trying to figure out why you got so angry when you thought...\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't get it. She did call?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, no.\n\n**Patient:**\nDid she call or not? Tell me already.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, she didn't call.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo why are we back to this again?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause I got the feeling that when you got angry, you wanted your mother to call, just so that \nyou could get angry with her.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou have no idea what I'm looking for.\nYou just don't get it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOK.\nSo...\nwhy don't you explain it to me, then?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe thinks that what's written there is true.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat's true?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhatever it says. \"Suicidal tendencies\", blah, blah, blah.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThat's what your mother says is true?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe thinks that this accident is an opportunity to get rid of the sports thing.\nThat's what she calls it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBut what does that have to do with this report?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe's afraid.\nShe doesn't believe that...\nShe thinks that, because of all this competition and perfectionism, she thinks that I wanted to kill myself. And that's bullshit.\nIt's been like this for years.\nI've been under pressure for years and she has never supported me.\nAll the other mothers are right there, all over us, visiting the gym, the training camps, all of it.\nAnd the only thing she has to say is, \"What do you need this for?\" It's obvious she doesn't understand anything.\nAll this pressure, it doesn't make any difference.\nIt's so silly. Why would I hurt myself now, just before the nationals when I have all the...\nAnd if I fail the lawsuit, I really have no chance.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you mean, fail? Do you see this as a kind of test?\nTell me, why do you...\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy are you making it sound like it's...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat?\n\n**Patient:**\nI didn't come here for therapy.\nI just need you to write your opinion and tell me that I'm perfectly all right and tell them that I'm not some crazy who flies into cars every day.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs that why you came here today, Sophie?\nFor me to tell you that you're all right, that you're not crazy?\nIs that the test you're afraid of failing?\n\n**Patient:**\nI have to go.\nIt's ten to already.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou probably have to turn on your cellphone now.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy? Are you worried that I won't be available?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo.\n\n**Patient:**\nAre you this much of a pain in the ass with your daughter?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMuch, much worse, believe me.\nAnd yes, I do try to understand my daughter, if that's what you're asking.\n\n**Patient:**\nThat's not what I'm asking.\nLet's say she wants to talk to you now.\nWhat will she do? I don't think she'll wait till ten to so she can talk to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWho do you call, Sophie?\n\n**Patient:**\nNow you don't feel comfortable talking about your daughter.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nShe calls me at ten minutes before the hour, she leaves a message and I get back to her.\nBut who do you call?\n\n**Patient:**\nWho do I call for what?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhen you need to talk to someone.\n\n**Patient:**\nFour, one, one.\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

Not for therapy?\nSo, let's see if I'm, uh... if I'm getting this right.\nAre you suing the insurance company of the person who hit you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Their insurance company had me talk to a social worker.\nAnd... she started asking me all sorts of annoying questions.\nShe was really annoying so I refused to talk to her.\nShe started talking to me like she knew me, so I refused to talk and that didn't go over so well, so my mother said it would be better if I came to talk to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nRight. So what happened at the accident that requires a psychiatric opinion?\n\n**Patient:**\nI really don't remember what happened.\nI was on my bicycle and a car ran into me and I don't remember what happened next.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat did they tell you afterwards?\n\n**Patient:**\nThat I flew my bike right into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're... You're laughing at that.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat that sounds like, flying straight into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you find that funny, yeah?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause it reminds me of something about two years ago.\nA... A friend of mine, he took me out on this motorbike and he stopped to get something at a convenience store.\nAnyway, I was really bored so I pretended that I knew how to drive it.\nYou put your hands on the handlebars and go like this.\nWell, it was one of those monster bikes.\nJust by turning the handle a little, it just flies.\nSo, suddenly, I'm like, zoom, and it takes off.\nMy head, it whips back like this and when I look down, I realise I'm riding into the street.\nTotally crashed into a car.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nThere was this old woman standing nearby and she saw all this. \"I saw her. She did it on purpose.\n\"She tried to kill herself. She tried to kill herself.\" That's what she was yelling?\nYeah, she was like a crazy woman.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\nCourse, it couldn't have been that funny when it happened, I'm sure?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Not really.\nI wanted to kill her. I was just lying there.\nI couldn't move. I couldn't do anything.\nI wanted to yell, \"Shut up, you... you idiot.\n\"Why are you screaming?\" You know? But I couldn't speak.\nIt's like this feeling...\nwhen somebody says something about you and you can't defend yourself.\nIt's totally unfair.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLike that social worker you were talking about.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat does she have to do with it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, didn't you feel that she was speaking for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, but I could have said something.\nI just didn't want to.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHm.\nSo, tell me a little more about this, uh, this accident.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's all in that report.\n\nWhere did it happen?\n\n**Patient:**\nIn a gas station on Madison near the gym where I train.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you were on the way to the gym?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. I told you I don't remember anything.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you feel comfortable talking about yourself, Sophie?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nMy name is Sophie. I'm 16 years old.\nI've been a gymnast since the age of six and a half.\nI was US junior champion at the age of 12.\nI'm an only child.\nI don't know. What do you wanna know?\nIn another few months are the national trials.\nLast chance to qualify for the Olympics.\nI'm kind of like... an Olympic hopeful.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWow.\nThat's really impressive. Congratulations.\n\n**Patient:**\nThank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo how is life in general?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, apart from the gymnastics.\nHow's life?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's great.\nI just don't have the energy for This Is Your Life right now.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThis Is Your Life? What do... What do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nYou know, like the TV show.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're way too young to know about that show.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's on DVD. My mom's friend watches it all the time.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you think of it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's OK.\nSome of the people on it are so old.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n Why do you think they put old people on that?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Cos they have nothing better to do?\nThey're retired and dying off fast so they put them on the show before it's too late.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo do you think you can help me with this professional opinion or not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's not that simple, Sophie.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause it's not like an X-ray where you can take photographs, look at the results and then you go on your way.\nIt doesn't quite work like that.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nOK, so I guess I'll leave.\nWould you at least like to read what it says in the report?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIf you want me to.\n\n**Patient:**\nLike you already know what it says?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. I've no idea what it says.\n\n**Patient:**\nListen, I didn't come here to talk about myself.\nI just need your opinion.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you want me to give you my opinion based on what I read and the conversation that we've had today, is that it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIs that a problem?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. No.\nI'll write up an opinion and, um...\nwhen you come next week, you can decide whether you want to use it or not.\n\n**Patient:**\nJust like that, without any more questions?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, what kind of questions do you want me to ask?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Shrink-like questions.\nSay, about Mom, Dad, that kind of thing?\nDoesn't sound like you're interested.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy would you say that, Sophie?\nI am very interested in everything that you have to say.\nI mean that.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou spoke to my mother already, didn't you?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI didn't.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou already know what it says in there.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI've never spoken to her.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou did and you're letting me sit here and you know exactly what's in that envelope.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWas I... Was I supposed to talk to her?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat, did you, like, plan everything?\nLike I'm some kind of idiot, you planned some charade?\nWhat's the point? Whatever. She would send me to someone like you.\nI should have listened to my father. He called them a cult of crazies.\nOpen the door for me, please.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd if I did speak to your mom?\n\n**Patient:**\nI knew it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, then?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt means you're a liar, OK?\nCos I know how it's supposed to work.\nYou're supposed to read that report and ask the stupid shrink questions you ask.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoesn't it seems unprofessional to so not do it that way?\nMaybe I have something to say about what it says in there.\nI just wanted to read the report by myself before our meeting next week. That's all.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat meeting next week?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'd like us to meet three or four times for me to form an opinion of you, to get to know you a little.\nDon't you think?\nOtherwise... it wouldn't be professional.\nHm?\nI'll read it now.\nOK?\nSo are all these ships instead of sailing for real?\n\n**Patient:**\nUh-huh.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAt least you won't get seasick.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh...\nI don't know about that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nSometimes I can get quite wobbly just sitting right here.\nYou have to make a round window to the outside.\nThen you'll feel like you're in a real ship.\nDid you really read all those books or is it just to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUh-huh.\n\n**Patient:**\nYes, you read them or yes, you're trying to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nI've read them.\nI feel sorry for the books up there.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh. Why do you feel sorry for them?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhere would you put them?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. They're your fucking books.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou suffer from asthma.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. How do you know that?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThere's an inhaler here.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, thanks. I've been looking everywhere for that. Thank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, you could have died without it?\nAccording to what it says here...\nit looks like you could have died too.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. That would have solved a lot of problems.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat would it solve?\n\n**Patient:**\nNothing. I didn't mean anything by it.\nCan I talk to you like a normal person?\nDo you drive your daughter crazy with questions like this too?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMuch more crazy, believe me.\nHow d'you know I had a daughter?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause you do.\nYou know my mother.\nYou were on the PTA committee at Arlington elementary.\nI was there before I went off to a private school.\nI was in the same year as your daughter.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, why didn't you tell me that before?\n\n**Patient:**\nHm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou said that the, uh... that the social worker spoke to you like she knew you.\n\n**Patient:**\nShe was such a retard.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDid she ask you if, um... if you think about death a lot?\n\n**Patient:**\nHow did you know that?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAccording to what it says here, she was trying to prove that the accident was your fault.\nIt's a good thing you didn't answer any of her questions.\nBy the way, everybody thinks about death.\nI bet she didn't say that, though.\nDid she ask you if you had any specific thoughts about death?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you?\n\n**Patient:**\nDo I what?\nEveryone... Everyone thinks about death and, uh...\nimagines how it will come to them.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you have any more specific thoughts about it?\nI mean, maybe you have certain thoughts that you'd like to talk about.\n\n**Patient:**\nUnless you're worried about what I...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'm not worried.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nIs this how it's going to be for three appointments?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs this a little difficult for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nCan I have some water?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSure.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHang on a minute.\nSorry about this. It's for my little patients, the elves.\nIt's a bendy one.\nYou need help with that?\nMust be really hard to be, uh... be handicapped like that.\nWhat's the hardest thing about it?\n\n**Patient:**\nEveryone treats me like a baby.\nHm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDid you come here by yourself today?\n\n**Patient:**\nYes. By bus.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYour mom didn't offer to drive you?\nYeah, right. She knew there was no chance I'd say yes.\nBefore, when you got angry, when, uh...\nwhen you thought that she'd called me, I asked myself, \"Why didn't she call?\" It makes sense that she would call me first.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI don't... What do you mean?\nI'm trying to figure out why you got so angry when you thought...\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't get it. She did call?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, no.\n\n**Patient:**\nDid she call or not? Tell me already.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, she didn't call.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo why are we back to this again?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause I got the feeling that when you got angry, you wanted your mother to call, just so that \nyou could get angry with her.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou have no idea what I'm looking for.\nYou just don't get it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOK.\nSo...\nwhy don't you explain it to me, then?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe thinks that what's written there is true.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat's true?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhatever it says. \"Suicidal tendencies\", blah, blah, blah.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThat's what your mother says is true?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe thinks that this accident is an opportunity to get rid of the sports thing.\nThat's what she calls it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBut what does that have to do with this report?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe's afraid.\nShe doesn't believe that...\nShe thinks that, because of all this competition and perfectionism, she thinks that I wanted to kill myself. And that's bullshit.\nIt's been like this for years.\nI've been under pressure for years and she has never supported me.\nAll the other mothers are right there, all over us, visiting the gym, the training camps, all of it.\nAnd the only thing she has to say is, \"What do you need this for?\" It's obvious she doesn't understand anything.\nAll this pressure, it doesn't make any difference.\nIt's so silly. Why would I hurt myself now, just before the nationals when I have all the...\nAnd if I fail the lawsuit, I really have no chance.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you mean, fail? Do you see this as a kind of test?\nTell me, why do you...\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy are you making it sound like it's...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat?\n\n**Patient:**\nI didn't come here for therapy.\nI just need you to write your opinion and tell me that I'm perfectly all right and tell them that I'm not some crazy who flies into cars every day.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs that why you came here today, Sophie?\nFor me to tell you that you're all right, that you're not crazy?\nIs that the test you're afraid of failing?\n\n**Patient:**\nI have to go.\nIt's ten to already.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou probably have to turn on your cellphone now.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy? Are you worried that I won't be available?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo.\n\n**Patient:**\nAre you this much of a pain in the ass with your daughter?\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

I am your therapist.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo, are there any rules?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nEr, rules?\n\n**Patient:**\nGround rules.\nAnything I should know before we start?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh, not really.\nIt's more or less up to you.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, right, right. I'm a customer.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYeah.\nThough in my profession, we say that the customer is always wrong.\nIt's a... It's a therapist's joke.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo, do you recognise me?\nNo.\nI'm sorry, uh, should I?\nI was told you were the best, a man in tune with everything around him,\nso you should.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThank you.\nBut I do think that in this profession, \"the best\" is really a matter of personal opinion.\nNo, the best can be established by facts and figures.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou're the best. I did my research.\nCouple of former patients, someone who knew you from graduate school.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoes that pressure you?\nIs it important for you to know\nthat I am the best?\n\n**Patient:**\nYes.\nIt's nothing personal, I always go to the best - dentists, mechanics.\nYou know what they say - save now, pay later.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what do you think being the best therapist entails?\n\n**Patient:**\nDo you recognise me?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, I...\nI... I don't.\n\n**Patient:**\nLet me help.\nThe Madrasah Murderer.\nDoes that mean anything to you?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt wasn't that long ago.\nUS Navy aircraft hit a target on the outskirts of Baghdad.\nNaval Intelligence identified the structure as an insurgents' safe house, a bunker. Turns out it's a madrasah.\nLet me tell you what that is. It's an Islamic religious school.\nBoys like bees in a beehive studying the Koran.\n16 of them... dead.\nRings a bell?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes, I remember that, yes.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo, that's me.\nI flew that mission.\nThe Madrasah Murderer.\nSo, uh, do you surf the net?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, somehow... Well, it wasn't really somehow, it was...\n\n**Patient:**\nLet's call a spade a spade. A leak. Probably another intelligence fuck-up.\nAnyway, I was identified as the pilot in that mission and my photo was placed on fundamentalist websites.\nAnd I'm not talking Al Jazeera, I'm talking websites that are...\nasking for my head on a platter.\nOffering up the heavens and 40 virgins to anyone who will slit my throat from ear to ear.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHere, um...\n\n**Patient:**\nHere you are. It's not a recent photo. It's a photo taken when I was 18.\nOn a high-school trip to Europe, Holland.\nThat city with the miniatures. Ult... Utrecht.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUtrecht.\n\n**Patient:**\nRight.\nSo while I'm talking to you, a million fanatics are downloading my portrait and printing it out as a dartboard.\nSilly motherfuckers.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo, why have you come to see me?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhoa, whoa. We'll get to that.\nSo you're probably thinking, \"What's it like?\n\"He flew his mission, then he flew back \"and he saw the bodies of those children on CNN.\" You're probably trying to figure out what went through his head.\nLet me tell you, after that kind of mission, I don't watch CNN.\nI go to sleep.\nI'm dead tired.\nAnd you're probably dying to ask how I can sleep nights.\nOK, um...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow do you sleep?\n\n**Patient:**\nI sleep well, thank you very much, knowing it was mission accomplished and with great precision.\nI followed my orders, which were hit my target and hit it on time.\nTime and target. Do you know, we have to hit our targets within two seconds of the estimated time?\nIt's surgical. And that's one small window and I have never missed it.\nIf I had failed that task, I'd be in trouble with my superiors, with my conscience and with the system.\nBut I hit my target.\nSo, I sleep like a baby.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUm, h-how many...\nchildren...\ndied in this... in this mission?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe media puts it at 16.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd the air force?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe navy, Doctor, listen.\nThe navy says nothing and why should it?\nWe're not into body counts, we just hit targets.\nWe don't look back over our shoulder.\nWe do our thing so you can sit here in peace, talking to people for a living.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n So when did you hear that children had been killed?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe following afternoon. I heard it on the internet.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat exactly did you hear?\nAnything specifically that you remember?\n\n**Patient:**\nLike what? It's not like there's time in the day to be surfing the net, this was a moment, I got away.\nThere's a lot of stuff to keep me busy.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat kind of stuff?\n\n**Patient:**\nMission review, aerial photos, videos. Just data, stuff.\nPreparation versus execution.\nEvery tiny technical aspect of our flight is recorded and analysed by the man.\nThere's nowhere to hide. And that's the way it should be.\nIt's just stuff and more stuff.\nWhen my mother died, my father had a year's worth of stuff to deal with.\nLast will and testament, her office, garden, a lifetime of photo albums.\nAnd every time I talked to him, I'd ask how he was, expecting, uh...\nyou know, that... he'd break down.\nFinally.\n\"It never ends, Alex, it never ends. Your mother left such a mess.\n\"She didn't know she was gonna die.\" And that's all he said.\nAfter less than a year, he met another woman and got married, just like that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow did that make you feel?\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, surprised. A whole life together and not a single tear.\nMm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's interesting that you compare the death of your mother with this mission that you've just flown.\n\n**Patient:**\nThat's very clever of you.\nBut there's no relation whatsoever.\nMy mother's death was the most traumatic event in my life so far.\nThat mission was just another mission for Alex. There is no comparison.\nAnyway, look, that's over and I'm back now at my home base and now I'm on R&R.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat kind of things do you do for R&R?\n\n**Patient:**\nDon't try to get ahead of me.\nI'm a runner. I was a hell of a runner in high school and I'm still a good one for an old man. So, I run with my fairy friend.\nThis gay guy who could kick your ass at any sport.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd does he have a name, this friend?\n\n**Patient:**\nMm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDaniel.\n\n**Patient:**\nDaniel.\nWe've been running together for a long time, between six and ten miles.\nDepending on whether one of us is on his period. Only this time, I challenged him.\nIt was no good running in the Middle East, not for the US military, unless you want a bomb to blow your balls off!\nSo, I wanted to do some serious running. I said, \"Let's go for 15.\" After 15 miles, I said, \"20.\" He didn't want it.\nI said, \"OK, I'll go on my own.\" So, he followed.\nI said, \"You know, only six more and it's a marathon. Let's do it.\" He wanted to stop. Little bitch.\nBut I wasn't gonna stop.\nNo stop.\nWe were out of water, we were on fumes.\nAt 22 miles, I had a heart attack and died.\nA textbook case, straight out of med school.\nEnlargement of the left ventricle, in accordance with the family history on both sides, fatal.\nAccording to the EKG and according to statistics, I had a 97.3 per cent chance of dying.\nOr a 2.7 per cent chance of living. Anyway, dead.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou actually died?\n\n**Patient:**\nIn the clinical sense no pulse, no brain activity, total clinical death.\nBut here I am.\nNow I'm gonna disappoint you, Doctor.\nWanna know why I'm gonna disappoint you?\nLet me help you - the light, the tunnel, life flashing before my eyes.\nThat's what you're interested in, right?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, I wasn't actually thinking of that at all, but I am interested.\nTell me.\n\n**Patient:**\nI couldn't give a shit about it either.\nBut that's all everyone wanted to know about - my father, my wife.\nEveryone wanted to hear about the goddamn tunnel.\nJust such bullshit.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you feel that maybe you disappointed people by not having that experience?\nThat maybe in some way you failed to deliver the goods?\n\n**Patient:**\nNobody really knows what was going through my mind during those last few moments.\nAs soon as there was no more tunnel, no one was interested.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd what was going through your mind?\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, I knew what was happening, you can tell.\nAnd you're afraid it's the end.\nIn all that time until I lost consciousness...\nAll that time... I don't know, it was maybe seconds, maybe half a minute.\nAll that time I kept trying to figure out if I had a hard-on.\nI don't know how I remembered, it was something my grandmother told me, when I was in high school, and she said when Grandpa died, she found him lying naked in the bathtub with a huge erection.\nNow, he's... he was 92 years old.\nShe hadn't seen an erection like that in 20 years.\nShe liked it. She said that was God's final gift to a man.\nA dead man's boner. They call it angel lust.\nAnyway, I'm lying there thinking about that story.\nI know what's happening and I said to myself, \"God Almighty, just don't let me have an erection now, not a hard-on.\" Because if you had an erection, it would mean...\nThat would mean that I was dead.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd your friend Daniel was with you throughout this?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, resuscitation, CPR... Daniel's a doctor. I forgot to say that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh. For a minute I thought you were going to say something else, that perhaps your fear of an erection was associated with the presence of your friend, Daniel.\n\n**Patient:**\nExcuse me?\nYou're exaggerating. I explained something simple, a dead man's erection - what's that got to do with Daniel?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, maybe I didn't make myself clear earlier on when I was talking about the customer always being wrong.\nWhat I meant was that sometimes the patient hides things from his therapist, from himself.\nAnd so part of our job is to uncover the things that we hide.\n\n**Patient:**\n So, my secret is I'm afraid of homosexuals?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, not necessarily. But I just wanted to clarify that.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, that's neither here nor there. I want to get to my point.\nI didn't have the erection, so relax.\nBut I remember very vividly that moment just before passing out, before losing consciousness.\nLosing consciousness, that's a funny expression.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy do you think that's a funny expression?\n\n**Patient:**\nLosing consciousness - it's an expression my father would use.\nEverything in terms of profits and loss.\nFits him like a glove.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo something about how you describe your last moments is equated with your father's seeing things in terms of profit and loss?\n\n**Patient:**\nOK, OK, with all due respect, I think we've come to this way too early.\nThe father-son relationship stuff shouldn't come up so soon.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou think it's too soon?\n\n**Patient:**\nForget what I feel.\nI know it's too soon. I wanna know what you think.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you're... You're testing me?\n\n**Patient:**\nI'm entitled to some testing. I'm paying.\nActually, I think you've been testing me since you walked in.\nYou've asked about me and my reputation, you ask, you practically demand that I ask certain questions that you think I am dying to ask.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's important to you, I think, that I adhere to certain standards you set before you walked through the door.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat's wrong with that? Look, I did my research.\nIt's a 1  1/2 hour drive to get here and I'm paying you good money.\nAnd I'm expected to tell you, a perfect stranger, the most intimate things about my life.\nPlus there are risks here.\nIt's not like the navy's gonna give me a medal for spilling my guts, I'm not gonna open up to you without knowing what you are.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd what do you expect to find, Alex?\nHow are we going to know that I'm a good enough therapist for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nI'll know...\naccording to your opinion.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMy opinion of what?\n\n**Patient:**\nOf the issue I came to talk about.\nBut I'll come to that in a minute.\nIt's to do with what happened after taking me out of the freezer.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe freezer?\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, you mean that you were grounded?\nNo, literally frozen. They froze me.\nThe mobile intensive care unit arrived and put me in a suit that freezes you.\nThey got one no more than three-quarters of a mile from where I collapsed.\nAnd their ER is tops.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLet's go back to this...\n\n**Patient:**\nWe're getting there. You have no patience.\nI was told you're a good listener.\nNow look, it works on a very simple principle.\nIt reduces the shock to the body's systems by dropping the body temperature.\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

Come on in.\n\n**Patient:**\nHere?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nDo you need any help with the...\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. It's OK.\nAnna Colden recommended that I talk to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnna Colden?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe's my lawyer. She heard about you from a friend of yours.\nI mean, a friend of hers, not a friend of yours.\nFrom a patient of yours who is a friend of hers. Sorry.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMm. So, Anna Colden recommended you through a patient.\n\n**Patient:**\nDo you know his name?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI don't know.\nSo what did Anna recommend me for?\n\n**Patient:**\nAfter my accident... I told you on the phone about the accident?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\n\n**Patient:**\nThey told me I need the opinion of a psychiatrist because the insurance company of the car that hit me has a problem with my injuries or...\nsomething like that. So that's why I'm here.\nI'm here for your professional opinion, not for...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNot for... Not for therapy?\nSo, let's see if I'm, uh... if I'm getting this right.\nAre you suing the insurance company of the person who hit you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Their insurance company had me talk to a social worker.\nAnd... she started asking me all sorts of annoying questions.\nShe was really annoying so I refused to talk to her.\nShe started talking to me like she knew me, so I refused to talk and that didn't go over so well, so my mother said it would be better if I came to talk to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nRight. So what happened at the accident that requires a psychiatric opinion?\n\n**Patient:**\nI really don't remember what happened.\nI was on my bicycle and a car ran into me and I don't remember what happened next.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat did they tell you afterwards?\n\n**Patient:**\nThat I flew my bike right into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're... You're laughing at that.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat that sounds like, flying straight into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you find that funny, yeah?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause it reminds me of something about two years ago.\nA... A friend of mine, he took me out on this motorbike and he stopped to get something at a convenience store.\nAnyway, I was really bored so I pretended that I knew how to drive it.\nYou put your hands on the handlebars and go like this.\nWell, it was one of those monster bikes.\nJust by turning the handle a little, it just flies.\nSo, suddenly, I'm like, zoom, and it takes off.\nMy head, it whips back like this and when I look down, I realise I'm riding into the street.\nTotally crashed into a car.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nThere was this old woman standing nearby and she saw all this. \"I saw her. She did it on purpose.\n\"She tried to kill herself. She tried to kill herself.\" That's what she was yelling?\nYeah, she was like a crazy woman.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\nCourse, it couldn't have been that funny when it happened, I'm sure?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Not really.\nI wanted to kill her. I was just lying there.\nI couldn't move. I couldn't do anything.\nI wanted to yell, \"Shut up, you... you idiot.\n\"Why are you screaming?\" You know? But I couldn't speak.\nIt's like this feeling...\nwhen somebody says something about you and you can't defend yourself.\nIt's totally unfair.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLike that social worker you were talking about.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat does she have to do with it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, didn't you feel that she was speaking for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, but I could have said something.\nI just didn't want to.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHm.\nSo, tell me a little more about this, uh, this accident.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's all in that report.\n\nWhere did it happen?\n\n**Patient:**\nIn a gas station on Madison near the gym where I train.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you were on the way to the gym?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. I told you I don't remember anything.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you feel comfortable talking about yourself, Sophie?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nMy name is Sophie. I'm 16 years old.\nI've been a gymnast since the age of six and a half.\nI was US junior champion at the age of 12.\nI'm an only child.\nI don't know. What do you wanna know?\nIn another few months are the national trials.\nLast chance to qualify for the Olympics.\nI'm kind of like... an Olympic hopeful.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWow.\nThat's really impressive. Congratulations.\n\n**Patient:**\nThank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo how is life in general?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, apart from the gymnastics.\nHow's life?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's great.\nI just don't have the energy for This Is Your Life right now.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThis Is Your Life? What do... What do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nYou know, like the TV show.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're way too young to know about that show.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's on DVD. My mom's friend watches it all the time.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you think of it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's OK.\nSome of the people on it are so old.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n Why do you think they put old people on that?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Cos they have nothing better to do?\nThey're retired and dying off fast so they put them on the show before it's too late.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo do you think you can help me with this professional opinion or not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's not that simple, Sophie.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause it's not like an X-ray where you can take photographs, look at the results and then you go on your way.\nIt doesn't quite work like that.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nOK, so I guess I'll leave.\nWould you at least like to read what it says in the report?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIf you want me to.\n\n**Patient:**\nLike you already know what it says?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. I've no idea what it says.\n\n**Patient:**\nListen, I didn't come here to talk about myself.\nI just need your opinion.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you want me to give you my opinion based on what I read and the conversation that we've had today, is that it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIs that a problem?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. No.\nI'll write up an opinion and, um...\nwhen you come next week, you can decide whether you want to use it or not.\n\n**Patient:**\nJust like that, without any more questions?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, what kind of questions do you want me to ask?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Shrink-like questions.\nSay, about Mom, Dad, that kind of thing?\nDoesn't sound like you're interested.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy would you say that, Sophie?\nI am very interested in everything that you have to say.\nI mean that.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou spoke to my mother already, didn't you?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI didn't.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou already know what it says in there.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI've never spoken to her.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou did and you're letting me sit here and you know exactly what's in that envelope.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWas I... Was I supposed to talk to her?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat, did you, like, plan everything?\nLike I'm some kind of idiot, you planned some charade?\nWhat's the point? Whatever. She would send me to someone like you.\nI should have listened to my father. He called them a cult of crazies.\nOpen the door for me, please.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd if I did speak to your mom?\n\n**Patient:**\nI knew it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, then?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt means you're a liar, OK?\nCos I know how it's supposed to work.\nYou're supposed to read that report and ask the stupid shrink questions you ask.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoesn't it seems unprofessional to so not do it that way?\nMaybe I have something to say about what it says in there.\nI just wanted to read the report by myself before our meeting next week. That's all.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat meeting next week?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'd like us to meet three or four times for me to form an opinion of you, to get to know you a little.\nDon't you think?\nOtherwise... it wouldn't be professional.\nHm?\nI'll read it now.\nOK?\nSo are all these ships instead of sailing for real?\n\n**Patient:**\nUh-huh.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAt least you won't get seasick.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh...\nI don't know about that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nSometimes I can get quite wobbly just sitting right here.\nYou have to make a round window to the outside.\nThen you'll feel like you're in a real ship.\nDid you really read all those books or is it just to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUh-huh.\n\n**Patient:**\nYes, you read them or yes, you're trying to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nI've read them.\nI feel sorry for the books up there.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh. Why do you feel sorry for them?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhere would you put them?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. They're your fucking books.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou suffer from asthma.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. How do you know that?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThere's an inhaler here.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, thanks. I've been looking everywhere for that. Thank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, you could have died without it?\nAccording to what it says here...\nit looks like you could have died too.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. That would have solved a lot of problems.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat would it solve?\n\n**Patient:**\nNothing. I didn't mean anything by it.\nCan I talk to you like a normal person?\nDo you drive your daughter crazy with questions like this too?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMuch more crazy, believe me.\nHow d'you know I had a daughter?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause you do.\nYou know my mother.\nYou were on the PTA committee at Arlington elementary.\nI was there before I went off to a private school.\nI was in the same year as your daughter.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, why didn't you tell me that before?\n\n**Patient:**\nHm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou said that the, uh... that the social worker spoke to you like she knew you.\n\n**Patient:**\nShe was such a retard.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDid she ask you if, um... if you think about death a lot?\n\n**Patient:**\nHow did you know that?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAccording to what it says here, she was trying to prove that the accident was your fault.\nIt's a good thing you didn't answer any of her questions.\nBy the way, everybody thinks about death.\nI bet she didn't say that, though.\nDid she ask you if you had any specific thoughts about death?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you?\n\n**Patient:**\nDo I what?\nEveryone... Everyone thinks about death and, uh...\nimagines how it will come to them.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you have any more specific thoughts about it?\nI mean, maybe you have certain thoughts that you'd like to talk about.\n\n**Patient:**\nUnless you're worried about what I...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'm not worried.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nIs this how it's going to be for three appointments?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs this a little difficult for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nCan I have some water?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSure.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHang on a minute.\nSorry about this. It's for my little patients, the elves.\nIt's a bendy one.\nYou need help with that?\nMust be really hard to be, uh... be handicapped like that.\nWhat's the hardest thing about it?\n\n**Patient:**\nEveryone treats me like a baby.\nHm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDid you come here by yourself today?\n\n**Patient:**\nYes. By bus.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYour mom didn't offer to drive you?\nYeah, right. She knew there was no chance I'd say yes.\nBefore, when you got angry, when, uh...\nwhen you thought that she'd called me, I asked myself, \"Why didn't she call?\" It makes sense that she would call me first.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI don't... What do you mean?\nI'm trying to figure out why you got so angry when you thought...\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't get it. She did call?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, no.\n\n**Patient:**\nDid she call or not? Tell me already.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, she didn't call.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo why are we back to this again?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause I got the feeling that when you got angry, you wanted your mother to call, just so that \nyou could get angry with her.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou have no idea what I'm looking for.\nYou just don't get it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOK.\nSo...\nwhy don't you explain it to me, then?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe thinks that what's written there is true.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat's true?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhatever it says. \"Suicidal tendencies\", blah, blah, blah.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThat's what your mother says is true?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe thinks that this accident is an opportunity to get rid of the sports thing.\nThat's what she calls it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBut what does that have to do with this report?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe's afraid.\nShe doesn't believe that...\nShe thinks that, because of all this competition and perfectionism, she thinks that I wanted to kill myself. And that's bullshit.\nIt's been like this for years.\nI've been under pressure for years and she has never supported me.\nAll the other mothers are right there, all over us, visiting the gym, the training camps, all of it.\nAnd the only thing she has to say is, \"What do you need this for?\" It's obvious she doesn't understand anything.\nAll this pressure, it doesn't make any difference.\nIt's so silly. Why would I hurt myself now, just before the nationals when I have all the...\nAnd if I fail the lawsuit, I really have no chance.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you mean, fail? Do you see this as a kind of test?\nTell me, why do you...\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy are you making it sound like it's...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat?\n\n**Patient:**\nI didn't come here for therapy.\nI just need you to write your opinion and tell me that I'm perfectly all right and tell them that I'm not some crazy who flies into cars every day.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs that why you came here today, Sophie?\nFor me to tell you that you're all right, that you're not crazy?\nIs that the test you're afraid of failing?\n\n**Patient:**\nI have to go.\nIt's ten to already.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou probably have to turn on your cellphone now.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy? Are you worried that I won't be available?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo.\n\n**Patient:**\nAre you this much of a pain in the ass with your daughter?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMuch, much worse, believe me.\nAnd yes, I do try to understand my daughter, if that's what you're asking.\n\n**Patient:**\nThat's not what I'm asking.\nLet's say she wants to talk to you now.\nWhat will she do? I don't think she'll wait till ten to so she can talk to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWho do you call, Sophie?\n\n**Patient:**\nNow you don't feel comfortable talking about your daughter.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nShe calls me at ten minutes before the hour, she leaves a message and I get back to her.\nBut who do you call?\n\n**Patient:**\nWho do I call for what?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhen you need to talk to someone.\n\n**Patient:**\nFour, one, one.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nFour, one, one?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah.\nHe's my father. He's moved so many times in the past few years, I can never remember his latest phone number.\nIt's like a family joke. We call four, one, one.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow do you get on with your dad?\n\n**Patient:**\nHe's always there for me.\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

Lenny barely sees her.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAre you... comfortable being here, with me without Amy?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, I'm comfortable.\nYou said we shouldn't start until we're both here, right?\nSo we wait.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWe can start at any time you want.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's just... If you don't mind that Amy has to hear it all again.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNah, it's OK. We'll wait.\nI'm just getting the sense, uh, Jake, that...\nthis is difficult for you to be here without her?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, it's not difficult.\nHi, Molly.\nEverything's fine.\nCan you hear me now? Great.\nListen, do you know where Amy is?\nIf I knew, I wouldn't be calling.\nShe's not picking up.\nDo you or don't you know where she is?\nMolly, I'm in the middle of something, OK?\nAll right, I'll let her know. OK, bye.\nHer mother, Jesus.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe way they talk, you can tell they're loaded.\nThey got money coming out of their asses.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAmy too?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat do you think?\nShe's lucky I keep things in perspective for her.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHer mother.\n\n**Patient:**\nYes, Molly, what is it?\nAn attack?\nAn attack of what?\nWhy do you always rush to the worst case scenario?\nWell, fine. Go on worrying. I'm not.\nBecause.\nI'm not worried. What are you gonna do about it? That's the way it is.\nI'm in the middle of something. OK?\nBye, bye.\nNow I'm in trouble with her mother, the hysteric.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nShe sounds anxious.\n\n**Patient:**\nShe's a wreck.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMaybe she's skipping through the stages of... anxiety.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell...\nIt's like... Let's say you arrange to meet somebody at a particular time and place, you arrive and they're not there and you think to yourself, \"Maybe I got the time or place wrong.\" And then you get to the stage where you get angry and you say, \"Where the hell are they? They're supposed to be here.\" And then you get to the stage of anxiety where you're worried if something has happened to them.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK, I'm out of here.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI think you should stay a few more minutes.\nShe was late last week, remember?\n\n**Patient:**\nMaybe I left my ringer off.\nNo, you idiot, her mother just called you.\nOK.\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

She heard about you from a friend of yours.\nI mean, a friend of hers, not a friend of yours.\nFrom a patient of yours who is a friend of hers. Sorry.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMm. So, Anna Colden recommended you through a patient.\n\n**Patient:**\nDo you know his name?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI don't know.\nSo what did Anna recommend me for?\n\n**Patient:**\nAfter my accident... I told you on the phone about the accident?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\n\n**Patient:**\nThey told me I need the opinion of a psychiatrist because the insurance company of the car that hit me has a problem with my injuries or...\nsomething like that. So that's why I'm here.\nI'm here for your professional opinion, not for...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNot for... Not for therapy?\nSo, let's see if I'm, uh... if I'm getting this right.\nAre you suing the insurance company of the person who hit you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Their insurance company had me talk to a social worker.\nAnd... she started asking me all sorts of annoying questions.\nShe was really annoying so I refused to talk to her.\nShe started talking to me like she knew me, so I refused to talk and that didn't go over so well, so my mother said it would be better if I came to talk to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nRight. So what happened at the accident that requires a psychiatric opinion?\n\n**Patient:**\nI really don't remember what happened.\nI was on my bicycle and a car ran into me and I don't remember what happened next.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat did they tell you afterwards?\n\n**Patient:**\nThat I flew my bike right into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're... You're laughing at that.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat that sounds like, flying straight into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you find that funny, yeah?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause it reminds me of something about two years ago.\nA... A friend of mine, he took me out on this motorbike and he stopped to get something at a convenience store.\nAnyway, I was really bored so I pretended that I knew how to drive it.\nYou put your hands on the handlebars and go like this.\nWell, it was one of those monster bikes.\nJust by turning the handle a little, it just flies.\nSo, suddenly, I'm like, zoom, and it takes off.\nMy head, it whips back like this and when I look down, I realise I'm riding into the street.\nTotally crashed into a car.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nThere was this old woman standing nearby and she saw all this. \"I saw her. She did it on purpose.\n\"She tried to kill herself. She tried to kill herself.\" That's what she was yelling?\nYeah, she was like a crazy woman.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\nCourse, it couldn't have been that funny when it happened, I'm sure?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Not really.\nI wanted to kill her. I was just lying there.\nI couldn't move. I couldn't do anything.\nI wanted to yell, \"Shut up, you... you idiot.\n\"Why are you screaming?\" You know? But I couldn't speak.\nIt's like this feeling...\nwhen somebody says something about you and you can't defend yourself.\nIt's totally unfair.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLike that social worker you were talking about.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat does she have to do with it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, didn't you feel that she was speaking for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, but I could have said something.\nI just didn't want to.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHm.\nSo, tell me a little more about this, uh, this accident.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's all in that report.\n\nWhere did it happen?\n\n**Patient:**\nIn a gas station on Madison near the gym where I train.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you were on the way to the gym?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. I told you I don't remember anything.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you feel comfortable talking about yourself, Sophie?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nMy name is Sophie. I'm 16 years old.\nI've been a gymnast since the age of six and a half.\nI was US junior champion at the age of 12.\nI'm an only child.\nI don't know. What do you wanna know?\nIn another few months are the national trials.\nLast chance to qualify for the Olympics.\nI'm kind of like... an Olympic hopeful.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWow.\nThat's really impressive. Congratulations.\n\n**Patient:**\nThank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo how is life in general?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, apart from the gymnastics.\nHow's life?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's great.\nI just don't have the energy for This Is Your Life right now.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThis Is Your Life? What do... What do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nYou know, like the TV show.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're way too young to know about that show.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's on DVD. My mom's friend watches it all the time.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you think of it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's OK.\nSome of the people on it are so old.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n Why do you think they put old people on that?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Cos they have nothing better to do?\nThey're retired and dying off fast so they put them on the show before it's too late.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo do you think you can help me with this professional opinion or not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's not that simple, Sophie.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause it's not like an X-ray where you can take photographs, look at the results and then you go on your way.\nIt doesn't quite work like that.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nOK, so I guess I'll leave.\nWould you at least like to read what it says in the report?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIf you want me to.\n\n**Patient:**\nLike you already know what it says?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. I've no idea what it says.\n\n**Patient:**\nListen, I didn't come here to talk about myself.\nI just need your opinion.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you want me to give you my opinion based on what I read and the conversation that we've had today, is that it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIs that a problem?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. No.\nI'll write up an opinion and, um...\nwhen you come next week, you can decide whether you want to use it or not.\n\n**Patient:**\nJust like that, without any more questions?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, what kind of questions do you want me to ask?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Shrink-like questions.\nSay, about Mom, Dad, that kind of thing?\nDoesn't sound like you're interested.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy would you say that, Sophie?\nI am very interested in everything that you have to say.\nI mean that.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou spoke to my mother already, didn't you?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI didn't.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou already know what it says in there.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI've never spoken to her.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou did and you're letting me sit here and you know exactly what's in that envelope.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWas I... Was I supposed to talk to her?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat, did you, like, plan everything?\nLike I'm some kind of idiot, you planned some charade?\nWhat's the point? Whatever. She would send me to someone like you.\nI should have listened to my father. He called them a cult of crazies.\nOpen the door for me, please.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd if I did speak to your mom?\n\n**Patient:**\nI knew it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, then?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt means you're a liar, OK?\nCos I know how it's supposed to work.\nYou're supposed to read that report and ask the stupid shrink questions you ask.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoesn't it seems unprofessional to so not do it that way?\nMaybe I have something to say about what it says in there.\nI just wanted to read the report by myself before our meeting next week. That's all.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat meeting next week?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'd like us to meet three or four times for me to form an opinion of you, to get to know you a little.\nDon't you think?\nOtherwise... it wouldn't be professional.\nHm?\nI'll read it now.\nOK?\nSo are all these ships instead of sailing for real?\n\n**Patient:**\nUh-huh.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAt least you won't get seasick.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh...\nI don't know about that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nSometimes I can get quite wobbly just sitting right here.\nYou have to make a round window to the outside.\nThen you'll feel like you're in a real ship.\nDid you really read all those books or is it just to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUh-huh.\n\n**Patient:**\nYes, you read them or yes, you're trying to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nI've read them.\nI feel sorry for the books up there.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh. Why do you feel sorry for them?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhere would you put them?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. They're your fucking books.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou suffer from asthma.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. How do you know that?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThere's an inhaler here.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, thanks. I've been looking everywhere for that. Thank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, you could have died without it?\nAccording to what it says here...\nit looks like you could have died too.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. That would have solved a lot of problems.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat would it solve?\n\n**Patient:**\nNothing. I didn't mean anything by it.\nCan I talk to you like a normal person?\nDo you drive your daughter crazy with questions like this too?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMuch more crazy, believe me.\nHow d'you know I had a daughter?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause you do.\nYou know my mother.\nYou were on the PTA committee at Arlington elementary.\nI was there before I went off to a private school.\nI was in the same year as your daughter.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, why didn't you tell me that before?\n\n**Patient:**\nHm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou said that the, uh... that the social worker spoke to you like she knew you.\n\n**Patient:**\nShe was such a retard.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDid she ask you if, um... if you think about death a lot?\n\n**Patient:**\nHow did you know that?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAccording to what it says here, she was trying to prove that the accident was your fault.\nIt's a good thing you didn't answer any of her questions.\nBy the way, everybody thinks about death.\nI bet she didn't say that, though.\nDid she ask you if you had any specific thoughts about death?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you?\n\n**Patient:**\nDo I what?\nEveryone... Everyone thinks about death and, uh...\nimagines how it will come to them.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you have any more specific thoughts about it?\nI mean, maybe you have certain thoughts that you'd like to talk about.\n\n**Patient:**\nUnless you're worried about what I...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'm not worried.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nIs this how it's going to be for three appointments?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs this a little difficult for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nCan I have some water?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSure.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHang on a minute.\nSorry about this. It's for my little patients, the elves.\nIt's a bendy one.\nYou need help with that?\nMust be really hard to be, uh... be handicapped like that.\nWhat's the hardest thing about it?\n\n**Patient:**\nEveryone treats me like a baby.\nHm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDid you come here by yourself today?\n\n**Patient:**\nYes. By bus.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYour mom didn't offer to drive you?\nYeah, right. She knew there was no chance I'd say yes.\nBefore, when you got angry, when, uh...\nwhen you thought that she'd called me, I asked myself, \"Why didn't she call?\" It makes sense that she would call me first.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI don't... What do you mean?\nI'm trying to figure out why you got so angry when you thought...\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't get it. She did call?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, no.\n\n**Patient:**\nDid she call or not? Tell me already.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, she didn't call.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo why are we back to this again?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause I got the feeling that when you got angry, you wanted your mother to call, just so that \nyou could get angry with her.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou have no idea what I'm looking for.\nYou just don't get it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOK.\nSo...\nwhy don't you explain it to me, then?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe thinks that what's written there is true.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat's true?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhatever it says. \"Suicidal tendencies\", blah, blah, blah.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThat's what your mother says is true?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe thinks that this accident is an opportunity to get rid of the sports thing.\nThat's what she calls it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBut what does that have to do with this report?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe's afraid.\nShe doesn't believe that...\nShe thinks that, because of all this competition and perfectionism, she thinks that I wanted to kill myself. And that's bullshit.\nIt's been like this for years.\nI've been under pressure for years and she has never supported me.\nAll the other mothers are right there, all over us, visiting the gym, the training camps, all of it.\nAnd the only thing she has to say is, \"What do you need this for?\" It's obvious she doesn't understand anything.\nAll this pressure, it doesn't make any difference.\nIt's so silly. Why would I hurt myself now, just before the nationals when I have all the...\nAnd if I fail the lawsuit, I really have no chance.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you mean, fail? Do you see this as a kind of test?\nTell me, why do you...\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy are you making it sound like it's...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat?\n\n**Patient:**\nI didn't come here for therapy.\nI just need you to write your opinion and tell me that I'm perfectly all right and tell them that I'm not some crazy who flies into cars every day.\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

It's disappointing.\nI thought I'd feel better, relieved.\nThought it'd be a lot more fun.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd it isn't?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, it's horrible.\nI don't know if I'm gonna be able to talk today, Doctor.\nI shouldn't have come, I should have just...\nI should have just called it off. I'm sorry.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAre you all right?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSit down. Sit.\n\n**Patient:**\nI've been sitting out in the park for about four hours.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHere?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah.\nI wanted to call it off, the session, but...\nI wasn't sure I'd be able to make it home alone.\nI took a cab here. My car's at home.\nGod, at least I think it is.\nYeah, yeah, my car's at home.\nGod, it's freezing. I came this close to knocking on your door and asking for a sweater.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhen was that?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know, maybe five or six.\nI can't remember. It was still dark.\nWaited for the sun to come up.\nI never waited this long for a sunrise, except maybe on a camping trip in fifth grade.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThank you.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou know what I did?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat?\n\n**Patient:**\nI held my cellphone and I watched the minutes go by.\nIt felt like forever for one minute to turn into the next.\nI thought to myself, \"How stupid is this?\n\"Dying on a street like roadkill outside your therapist's office.\" I'm sorry, Doctor, I...\nI should have called it off. I shouldn't have come.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou should have come here.\nWhat happened last night?\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, what didn't happen?\nWant the long version or the bottom line?\nBecause the bottom line's very simple.\nMy life is over.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThen you'd better tell me the long version.\n\n**Patient:**\nI left Andrew. We had a big blowout screaming, crying, the works.\nThen at some point, I called Ilona, and we went out for a drink, and...\nwe had a few drinks.\nListen, I'm not here. I'm so totally not here.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou are very much here, Laura.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, it's not me that's here.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBelieve me, you'd be shocked to know the person that's sitting here.\n\n**Patient:**\nDid some...\nI did some terrible things last night.\n I feel sick.\nI don't wanna throw up.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoesn't matter, it's no big deal.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat do you mean?\nIt's vomit. I'm not gonna vomit all over your rug.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's a cheap rug, Laura.\nLet's talk about what's really going on here.\nHm?\n\n**Patient:**\n  It's Andrew. He knows I'm here at this time. Why is he calling me here?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMaybe he's worried. You were out all night.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, right. If he really cared, he wouldn't have started with this shit.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nStart what?\n\n**Patient:**\nAt the club with this guy...\nOh, my God.\nHe had corduroy pants on, preppy sweater.\nRepublican probably.\n  Can I just step out for a second and let him know I'm here?\nI can't concentrate with this shit.\nJust a sec.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLaura, the call can wait.\n\n**Patient:**\n Andrew gave me an ultimatum.\nEither we get married or we split.\nSaid he wants an answer in a day or two at the most, or else he's out.\nSaid he can't take it any more.\nThat he loves me, that he doesn't believe I love him, not for real.\nThat it's been two years already, on and off, blah, blah, blah.\nI don't know why. All of a sudden, he just started ranting and raving.\nWe've talked about this stuff before, but it was all in theory if we stayed together, if.\nAnd suddenly out of the blue, I can't even remember what we were doing...\nWe were watching TV.\nAll of a sudden he just gets off the couch, grabs the remote and turns off the TV, and he turns to me and he has tears in his eyes and he says, \"That's it, I can't take it any more.\" So out of line. He promised he'd lay off the subject for a while.\nAnd all of a sudden he's on this crying bullshit.\nHe actually burst out crying. I've never seen him like that before.\nAnd to tell you the truth it really scared me.\nNo, it made me angry.\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

So that's why I'm here.\nI'm here for your professional opinion, not for...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNot for... Not for therapy?\nSo, let's see if I'm, uh... if I'm getting this right.\nAre you suing the insurance company of the person who hit you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Their insurance company had me talk to a social worker.\nAnd... she started asking me all sorts of annoying questions.\nShe was really annoying so I refused to talk to her.\nShe started talking to me like she knew me, so I refused to talk and that didn't go over so well, so my mother said it would be better if I came to talk to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nRight. So what happened at the accident that requires a psychiatric opinion?\n\n**Patient:**\nI really don't remember what happened.\nI was on my bicycle and a car ran into me and I don't remember what happened next.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat did they tell you afterwards?\n\n**Patient:**\nThat I flew my bike right into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're... You're laughing at that.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat that sounds like, flying straight into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you find that funny, yeah?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause it reminds me of something about two years ago.\nA... A friend of mine, he took me out on this motorbike and he stopped to get something at a convenience store.\nAnyway, I was really bored so I pretended that I knew how to drive it.\nYou put your hands on the handlebars and go like this.\nWell, it was one of those monster bikes.\nJust by turning the handle a little, it just flies.\nSo, suddenly, I'm like, zoom, and it takes off.\nMy head, it whips back like this and when I look down, I realise I'm riding into the street.\nTotally crashed into a car.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nThere was this old woman standing nearby and she saw all this. \"I saw her. She did it on purpose.\n\"She tried to kill herself. She tried to kill herself.\" That's what she was yelling?\nYeah, she was like a crazy woman.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\nCourse, it couldn't have been that funny when it happened, I'm sure?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Not really.\nI wanted to kill her. I was just lying there.\nI couldn't move. I couldn't do anything.\nI wanted to yell, \"Shut up, you... you idiot.\n\"Why are you screaming?\" You know? But I couldn't speak.\nIt's like this feeling...\nwhen somebody says something about you and you can't defend yourself.\nIt's totally unfair.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLike that social worker you were talking about.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat does she have to do with it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, didn't you feel that she was speaking for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, but I could have said something.\nI just didn't want to.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHm.\nSo, tell me a little more about this, uh, this accident.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's all in that report.\n\nWhere did it happen?\n\n**Patient:**\nIn a gas station on Madison near the gym where I train.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you were on the way to the gym?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. I told you I don't remember anything.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you feel comfortable talking about yourself, Sophie?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nMy name is Sophie. I'm 16 years old.\nI've been a gymnast since the age of six and a half.\nI was US junior champion at the age of 12.\nI'm an only child.\nI don't know. What do you wanna know?\nIn another few months are the national trials.\nLast chance to qualify for the Olympics.\nI'm kind of like... an Olympic hopeful.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWow.\nThat's really impressive. Congratulations.\n\n**Patient:**\nThank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo how is life in general?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, apart from the gymnastics.\nHow's life?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's great.\nI just don't have the energy for This Is Your Life right now.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThis Is Your Life? What do... What do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nYou know, like the TV show.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're way too young to know about that show.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's on DVD. My mom's friend watches it all the time.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you think of it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's OK.\nSome of the people on it are so old.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n Why do you think they put old people on that?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Cos they have nothing better to do?\nThey're retired and dying off fast so they put them on the show before it's too late.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo do you think you can help me with this professional opinion or not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's not that simple, Sophie.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause it's not like an X-ray where you can take photographs, look at the results and then you go on your way.\nIt doesn't quite work like that.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nOK, so I guess I'll leave.\nWould you at least like to read what it says in the report?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIf you want me to.\n\n**Patient:**\nLike you already know what it says?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. I've no idea what it says.\n\n**Patient:**\nListen, I didn't come here to talk about myself.\nI just need your opinion.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you want me to give you my opinion based on what I read and the conversation that we've had today, is that it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIs that a problem?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. No.\nI'll write up an opinion and, um...\nwhen you come next week, you can decide whether you want to use it or not.\n\n**Patient:**\nJust like that, without any more questions?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, what kind of questions do you want me to ask?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Shrink-like questions.\nSay, about Mom, Dad, that kind of thing?\nDoesn't sound like you're interested.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy would you say that, Sophie?\nI am very interested in everything that you have to say.\nI mean that.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou spoke to my mother already, didn't you?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI didn't.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou already know what it says in there.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI've never spoken to her.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou did and you're letting me sit here and you know exactly what's in that envelope.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWas I... Was I supposed to talk to her?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat, did you, like, plan everything?\nLike I'm some kind of idiot, you planned some charade?\nWhat's the point? Whatever.

That's all.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat meeting next week?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'd like us to meet three or four times for me to form an opinion of you, to get to know you a little.\nDon't you think?\nOtherwise... it wouldn't be professional.\nHm?\nI'll read it now.\nOK?\nSo are all these ships instead of sailing for real?\n\n**Patient:**\nUh-huh.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAt least you won't get seasick.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh...\nI don't know about that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nSometimes I can get quite wobbly just sitting right here.\nYou have to make a round window to the outside.\nThen you'll feel like you're in a real ship.\nDid you really read all those books or is it just to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUh-huh.\n\n**Patient:**\nYes, you read them or yes, you're trying to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nI've read them.\nI feel sorry for the books up there.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh. Why do you feel sorry for them?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhere would you put them?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. They're your fucking books.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou suffer from asthma.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. How do you know that?\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

I am your therapist.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo, are there any rules?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nEr, rules?\n\n**Patient:**\nGround rules.\nAnything I should know before we start?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh, not really.\nIt's more or less up to you.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, right, right. I'm a customer.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYeah.\nThough in my profession, we say that the customer is always wrong.\nIt's a... It's a therapist's joke.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo, do you recognise me?\nNo.\nI'm sorry, uh, should I?\nI was told you were the best, a man in tune with everything around him,\nso you should.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThank you.\nBut I do think that in this profession, \"the best\" is really a matter of personal opinion.\nNo, the best can be established by facts and figures.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou're the best. I did my research.\nCouple of former patients, someone who knew you from graduate school.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoes that pressure you?\nIs it important for you to know\nthat I am the best?\n\n**Patient:**\nYes.\nIt's nothing personal, I always go to the best - dentists, mechanics.\nYou know what they say - save now, pay later.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what do you think being the best therapist entails?\n\n**Patient:**\nDo you recognise me?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, I...\nI... I don't.\n\n**Patient:**\nLet me help.\nThe Madrasah Murderer.\nDoes that mean anything to you?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt wasn't that long ago.\nUS Navy aircraft hit a target on the outskirts of Baghdad.\nNaval Intelligence identified the structure as an insurgents' safe house, a bunker. Turns out it's a madrasah.\nLet me tell you what that is. It's an Islamic religious school.\nBoys like bees in a beehive studying the Koran.\n16 of them... dead.\nRings a bell?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes, I remember that, yes.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo, that's me.\nI flew that mission.\nThe Madrasah Murderer.\nSo, uh, do you surf the net?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, somehow... Well, it wasn't really somehow, it was...\n\n**Patient:**\nLet's call a spade a spade. A leak. Probably another intelligence fuck-up.\nAnyway, I was identified as the pilot in that mission and my photo was placed on fundamentalist websites.\nAnd I'm not talking Al Jazeera, I'm talking websites that are...\nasking for my head on a platter.\nOffering up the heavens and 40 virgins to anyone who will slit my throat from ear to ear.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHere, um...\n\n**Patient:**\nHere you are. It's not a recent photo. It's a photo taken when I was 18.\nOn a high-school trip to Europe, Holland.\nThat city with the miniatures. Ult... Utrecht.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUtrecht.\n\n**Patient:**\nRight.\nSo while I'm talking to you, a million fanatics are downloading my portrait and printing it out as a dartboard.\nSilly motherfuckers.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo, why have you come to see me?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhoa, whoa. We'll get to that.\nSo you're probably thinking, \"What's it like?\n\"He flew his mission, then he flew back \"and he saw the bodies of those children on CNN.\" You're probably trying to figure out what went through his head.\nLet me tell you, after that kind of mission, I don't watch CNN.\nI go to sleep.\nI'm dead tired.\nAnd you're probably dying to ask how I can sleep nights.\nOK, um...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow do you sleep?\n\n**Patient:**\nI sleep well, thank you very much, knowing it was mission accomplished and with great precision.\nI followed my orders, which were hit my target and hit it on time.\nTime and target. Do you know, we have to hit our targets within two seconds of the estimated time?\nIt's surgical. And that's one small window and I have never missed it.\nIf I had failed that task, I'd be in trouble with my superiors, with my conscience and with the system.\nBut I hit my target.\nSo, I sleep like a baby.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUm, h-how many...\nchildren...\ndied in this... in this mission?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe media puts it at 16.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd the air force?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe navy, Doctor, listen.\nThe navy says nothing and why should it?\nWe're not into body counts, we just hit targets.\nWe don't look back over our shoulder.\nWe do our thing so you can sit here in peace, talking to people for a living.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n So when did you hear that children had been killed?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe following afternoon. I heard it on the internet.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat exactly did you hear?\nAnything specifically that you remember?\n\n**Patient:**\nLike what? It's not like there's time in the day to be surfing the net, this was a moment, I got away.\nThere's a lot of stuff to keep me busy.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat kind of stuff?\n\n**Patient:**\nMission review, aerial photos, videos. Just data, stuff.\nPreparation versus execution.\nEvery tiny technical aspect of our flight is recorded and analysed by the man.\nThere's nowhere to hide. And that's the way it should be.\nIt's just stuff and more stuff.\nWhen my mother died, my father had a year's worth of stuff to deal with.\nLast will and testament, her office, garden, a lifetime of photo albums.\nAnd every time I talked to him, I'd ask how he was, expecting, uh...\nyou know, that... he'd break down.\nFinally.\n\"It never ends, Alex, it never ends. Your mother left such a mess.\n\"She didn't know she was gonna die.\" And that's all he said.\nAfter less than a year, he met another woman and got married, just like that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow did that make you feel?\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, surprised. A whole life together and not a single tear.\nMm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's interesting that you compare the death of your mother with this mission that you've just flown.\n\n**Patient:**\nThat's very clever of you.\nBut there's no relation whatsoever.\nMy mother's death was the most traumatic event in my life so far.\nThat mission was just another mission for Alex. There is no comparison.\nAnyway, look, that's over and I'm back now at my home base and now I'm on R&R.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat kind of things do you do for R&R?\n\n**Patient:**\nDon't try to get ahead of me.\nI'm a runner. I was a hell of a runner in high school and I'm still a good one for an old man. So, I run with my fairy friend.\nThis gay guy who could kick your ass at any sport.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd does he have a name, this friend?\n\n**Patient:**\nMm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDaniel.\n\n**Patient:**\nDaniel.\nWe've been running together for a long time, between six and ten miles.\nDepending on whether one of us is on his period. Only this time, I challenged him.\nIt was no good running in the Middle East, not for the US military, unless you want a bomb to blow your balls off!\nSo, I wanted to do some serious running. I said, \"Let's go for 15.\" After 15 miles, I said, \"20.\" He didn't want it.\nI said, \"OK, I'll go on my own.\" So, he followed.\nI said, \"You know, only six more and it's a marathon. Let's do it.\" He wanted to stop. Little bitch.\nBut I wasn't gonna stop.\nNo stop.\nWe were out of water, we were on fumes.\nAt 22 miles, I had a heart attack and died.\nA textbook case, straight out of med school.\nEnlargement of the left ventricle, in accordance with the family history on both sides, fatal.\nAccording to the EKG and according to statistics, I had a 97.3 per cent chance of dying.\nOr a 2.7 per cent chance of living. Anyway, dead.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou actually died?\n\n**Patient:**\nIn the clinical sense no pulse, no brain activity, total clinical death.\nBut here I am.\nNow I'm gonna disappoint you, Doctor.\nWanna know why I'm gonna disappoint you?\nLet me help you - the light, the tunnel, life flashing before my eyes.\nThat's what you're interested in, right?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, I wasn't actually thinking of that at all, but I am interested.\nTell me.\n\n**Patient:**\nI couldn't give a shit about it either.\nBut that's all everyone wanted to know about - my father, my wife.\nEveryone wanted to hear about the goddamn tunnel.\nJust such bullshit.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you feel that maybe you disappointed people by not having that experience?\nThat maybe in some way you failed to deliver the goods?\n\n**Patient:**\nNobody really knows what was going through my mind during those last few moments.\nAs soon as there was no more tunnel, no one was interested.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd what was going through your mind?\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, I knew what was happening, you can tell.\nAnd you're afraid it's the end.\nIn all that time until I lost consciousness...\nAll that time... I don't know, it was maybe seconds, maybe half a minute.\nAll that time I kept trying to figure out if I had a hard-on.\nI don't know how I remembered, it was something my grandmother told me, when I was in high school, and she said when Grandpa died, she found him lying naked in the bathtub with a huge erection.\nNow, he's... he was 92 years old.\nShe hadn't seen an erection like that in 20 years.\nShe liked it. She said that was God's final gift to a man.\nA dead man's boner. They call it angel lust.\nAnyway, I'm lying there thinking about that story.\nI know what's happening and I said to myself, \"God Almighty, just don't let me have an erection now, not a hard-on.\" Because if you had an erection, it would mean...\nThat would mean that I was dead.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd your friend Daniel was with you throughout this?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, resuscitation, CPR... Daniel's a doctor. I forgot to say that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh. For a minute I thought you were going to say something else, that perhaps your fear of an erection was associated with the presence of your friend, Daniel.\n\n**Patient:**\nExcuse me?\nYou're exaggerating. I explained something simple, a dead man's erection - what's that got to do with Daniel?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, maybe I didn't make myself clear earlier on when I was talking about the customer always being wrong.\nWhat I meant was that sometimes the patient hides things from his therapist, from himself.\nAnd so part of our job is to uncover the things that we hide.\n\n**Patient:**\n So, my secret is I'm afraid of homosexuals?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, not necessarily. But I just wanted to clarify that.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, that's neither here nor there. I want to get to my point.\nI didn't have the erection, so relax.\nBut I remember very vividly that moment just before passing out, before losing consciousness.\nLosing consciousness, that's a funny expression.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy do you think that's a funny expression?\n\n**Patient:**\nLosing consciousness - it's an expression my father would use.\nEverything in terms of profits and loss.\nFits him like a glove.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo something about how you describe your last moments is equated with your father's seeing things in terms of profit and loss?\n\n**Patient:**\nOK, OK, with all due respect, I think we've come to this way too early.\nThe father-son relationship stuff shouldn't come up so soon.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou think it's too soon?\n\n**Patient:**\nForget what I feel.\nI know it's too soon. I wanna know what you think.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you're... You're testing me?\n\n**Patient:**\nI'm entitled to some testing. I'm paying.\nActually, I think you've been testing me since you walked in.\nYou've asked about me and my reputation, you ask, you practically demand that I ask certain questions that you think I am dying to ask.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's important to you, I think, that I adhere to certain standards you set before you walked through the door.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat's wrong with that? Look, I did my research.\nIt's a 1  1/2 hour drive to get here and I'm paying you good money.\nAnd I'm expected to tell you, a perfect stranger, the most intimate things about my life.\nPlus there are risks here.\nIt's not like the navy's gonna give me a medal for spilling my guts, I'm not gonna open up to you without knowing what you are.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd what do you expect to find, Alex?\nHow are we going to know that I'm a good enough therapist for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nI'll know...\naccording to your opinion.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMy opinion of what?\n\n**Patient:**\nOf the issue I came to talk about.\nBut I'll come to that in a minute.\nIt's to do with what happened after taking me out of the freezer.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe freezer?\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, you mean that you were grounded?\nNo, literally frozen. They froze me.\nThe mobile intensive care unit arrived and put me in a suit that freezes you.\nThey got one no more than three-quarters of a mile from where I collapsed.\nAnd their ER is tops.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLet's go back to this...\n\n**Patient:**\nWe're getting there. You have no patience.\nI was told you're a good listener.\nNow look, it works on a very simple principle.\nIt reduces the shock to the body's systems by dropping the body temperature.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo how long were you...\n\n**Patient:**\nIn my case, 48 hours. It's a record.\nThere's no history of anyone who's been in that suit for such a long time.\nI guess I went a long way up that tunnel.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe tunnel that wasn't there?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, unfortunately not.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo tell me what you remember about this 48 hours.\n\n**Patient:**\nMostly I remember, um... a terrible fatigue.\nI guess that's why they call it \"dead tired\".\nIt's physical, but mainly mental exhaustion.\nAnd I remember very clearly the relief I felt when I succeeded in coming back over into the \nworld.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou say that you succeeded in coming back to this world.\nDid... Did you feel it was under your control?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat are you trying to get at?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'm not trying to get at anything.\nBut what you're describing is a strong will to live.\n\n**Patient:**\nDuring this experience, there was a decision to go on living.\nYeah, I guess you're right.\nDespite having made this effort to live...\neverybody's disappointed.\nIt's not every day people meet someone who's come back from the dead.\nIt's a one-in-a-million thing. And if you don't supply the goods, then...\nListen, I have never spent a day in my life in a hospital.\nYou get it? Never.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo, perhaps your anger isn't directed at those people interested in the tunnel.\nPerhaps you're angry at yourself, Alex. How your body betrayed you.\nThis is a systems failure that was not supposed to happen to somebody like you.\n\n**Patient:**\nHmh.\nI have a brother, who's not bright, he's a real-estate agent.\nAnyway, he's a great athlete. And he once proved to me, and he does his research, believe me...\nthat all the great quarterbacks in the history of football were also the best looking.\nNamath, Staubach, Cunningham, they're all good-Iooking people.\nThe best-Iooking students in the class are often great athletes.\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

She heard about you from a friend of yours.\nI mean, a friend of hers, not a friend of yours.\nFrom a patient of yours who is a friend of hers. Sorry.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMm. So, Anna Colden recommended you through a patient.\n\n**Patient:**\nDo you know his name?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI don't know.\nSo what did Anna recommend me for?\n\n**Patient:**\nAfter my accident... I told you on the phone about the accident?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\n\n**Patient:**\nThey told me I need the opinion of a psychiatrist because the insurance company of the car that hit me has a problem with my injuries or...\nsomething like that. So that's why I'm here.\nI'm here for your professional opinion, not for...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNot for... Not for therapy?\nSo, let's see if I'm, uh... if I'm getting this right.\nAre you suing the insurance company of the person who hit you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Their insurance company had me talk to a social worker.\nAnd... she started asking me all sorts of annoying questions.\nShe was really annoying so I refused to talk to her.\nShe started talking to me like she knew me, so I refused to talk and that didn't go over so well, so my mother said it would be better if I came to talk to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nRight. So what happened at the accident that requires a psychiatric opinion?\n\n**Patient:**\nI really don't remember what happened.\nI was on my bicycle and a car ran into me and I don't remember what happened next.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat did they tell you afterwards?\n\n**Patient:**\nThat I flew my bike right into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're... You're laughing at that.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat that sounds like, flying straight into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you find that funny, yeah?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause it reminds me of something about two years ago.\nA... A friend of mine, he took me out on this motorbike and he stopped to get something at a convenience store.\nAnyway, I was really bored so I pretended that I knew how to drive it.\nYou put your hands on the handlebars and go like this.\nWell, it was one of those monster bikes.\nJust by turning the handle a little, it just flies.\nSo, suddenly, I'm like, zoom, and it takes off.\nMy head, it whips back like this and when I look down, I realise I'm riding into the street.\nTotally crashed into a car.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nThere was this old woman standing nearby and she saw all this. \"I saw her. She did it on purpose.\n\"She tried to kill herself. She tried to kill herself.\" That's what she was yelling?\nYeah, she was like a crazy woman.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\nCourse, it couldn't have been that funny when it happened, I'm sure?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Not really.\nI wanted to kill her. I was just lying there.\nI couldn't move. I couldn't do anything.\nI wanted to yell, \"Shut up, you... you idiot.\n\"Why are you screaming?\" You know? But I couldn't speak.\nIt's like this feeling...\nwhen somebody says something about you and you can't defend yourself.\nIt's totally unfair.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLike that social worker you were talking about.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat does she have to do with it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, didn't you feel that she was speaking for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, but I could have said something.\nI just didn't want to.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHm.\nSo, tell me a little more about this, uh, this accident.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's all in that report.\n\nWhere did it happen?\n\n**Patient:**\nIn a gas station on Madison near the gym where I train.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you were on the way to the gym?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. I told you I don't remember anything.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you feel comfortable talking about yourself, Sophie?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nMy name is Sophie. I'm 16 years old.\nI've been a gymnast since the age of six and a half.\nI was US junior champion at the age of 12.\nI'm an only child.\nI don't know. What do you wanna know?\nIn another few months are the national trials.\nLast chance to qualify for the Olympics.\nI'm kind of like... an Olympic hopeful.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWow.\nThat's really impressive. Congratulations.\n\n**Patient:**\nThank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo how is life in general?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, apart from the gymnastics.\nHow's life?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's great.\nI just don't have the energy for This Is Your Life right now.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThis Is Your Life? What do... What do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nYou know, like the TV show.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're way too young to know about that show.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's on DVD. My mom's friend watches it all the time.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you think of it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's OK.\nSome of the people on it are so old.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n Why do you think they put old people on that?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Cos they have nothing better to do?\nThey're retired and dying off fast so they put them on the show before it's too late.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo do you think you can help me with this professional opinion or not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's not that simple, Sophie.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause it's not like an X-ray where you can take photographs, look at the results and then you go on your way.\nIt doesn't quite work like that.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nOK, so I guess I'll leave.\nWould you at least like to read what it says in the report?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIf you want me to.\n\n**Patient:**\nLike you already know what it says?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. I've no idea what it says.\n\n**Patient:**\nListen, I didn't come here to talk about myself.\nI just need your opinion.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you want me to give you my opinion based on what I read and the conversation that we've had today, is that it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIs that a problem?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. No.\nI'll write up an opinion and, um...\nwhen you come next week, you can decide whether you want to use it or not.\n\n**Patient:**\nJust like that, without any more questions?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, what kind of questions do you want me to ask?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Shrink-like questions.\nSay, about Mom, Dad, that kind of thing?\nDoesn't sound like you're interested.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy would you say that, Sophie?\nI am very interested in everything that you have to say.\nI mean that.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou spoke to my mother already, didn't you?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI didn't.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou already know what it says in there.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI've never spoken to her.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou did and you're letting me sit here and you know exactly what's in that envelope.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWas I... Was I supposed to talk to her?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat, did you, like, plan everything?\nLike I'm some kind of idiot, you planned some charade?\nWhat's the point? Whatever. She would send me to someone like you.\nI should have listened to my father. He called them a cult of crazies.\nOpen the door for me, please.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd if I did speak to your mom?\n\n**Patient:**\nI knew it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, then?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt means you're a liar, OK?\nCos I know how it's supposed to work.\nYou're supposed to read that report and ask the stupid shrink questions you ask.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoesn't it seems unprofessional to so not do it that way?\nMaybe I have something to say about what it says in there.\nI just wanted to read the report by myself before our meeting next week. That's all.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat meeting next week?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'd like us to meet three or four times for me to form an opinion of you, to get to know you a little.\nDon't you think?\nOtherwise... it wouldn't be professional.\nHm?\nI'll read it now.\nOK?\nSo are all these ships instead of sailing for real?\n\n**Patient:**\nUh-huh.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAt least you won't get seasick.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh...\nI don't know about that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nSometimes I can get quite wobbly just sitting right here.\nYou have to make a round window to the outside.\nThen you'll feel like you're in a real ship.\nDid you really read all those books or is it just to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUh-huh.\n\n**Patient:**\nYes, you read them or yes, you're trying to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nI've read them.\nI feel sorry for the books up there.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh. Why do you feel sorry for them?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhere would you put them?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. They're your fucking books.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou suffer from asthma.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. How do you know that?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThere's an inhaler here.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, thanks. I've been looking everywhere for that. Thank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, you could have died without it?\nAccording to what it says here...\nit looks like you could have died too.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. That would have solved a lot of problems.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat would it solve?\n\n**Patient:**\nNothing. I didn't mean anything by it.\nCan I talk to you like a normal person?\nDo you drive your daughter crazy with questions like this too?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMuch more crazy, believe me.\nHow d'you know I had a daughter?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause you do.\nYou know my mother.\nYou were on the PTA committee at Arlington elementary.\nI was there before I went off to a private school.\nI was in the same year as your daughter.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, why didn't you tell me that before?\n\n**Patient:**\nHm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou said that the, uh... that the social worker spoke to you like she knew you.\n\n**Patient:**\nShe was such a retard.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDid she ask you if, um... if you think about death a lot?\n\n**Patient:**\nHow did you know that?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAccording to what it says here, she was trying to prove that the accident was your fault.\nIt's a good thing you didn't answer any of her questions.\nBy the way, everybody thinks about death.\nI bet she didn't say that, though.\nDid she ask you if you had any specific thoughts about death?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you?\n\n**Patient:**\nDo I what?\nEveryone... Everyone thinks about death and, uh...\nimagines how it will come to them.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you have any more specific thoughts about it?\nI mean, maybe you have certain thoughts that you'd like to talk about.\n\n**Patient:**\nUnless you're worried about what I...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'm not worried.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nIs this how it's going to be for three appointments?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs this a little difficult for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nCan I have some water?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSure.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHang on a minute.\nSorry about this. It's for my little patients, the elves.\nIt's a bendy one.\nYou need help with that?\nMust be really hard to be, uh... be handicapped like that.\nWhat's the hardest thing about it?\n\n**Patient:**\nEveryone treats me like a baby.\nHm.\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

Well, it wasn't really somehow, it was...\n\n**Patient:**\nLet's call a spade a spade. A leak. Probably another intelligence fuck-up.\nAnyway, I was identified as the pilot in that mission and my photo was placed on fundamentalist websites.\nAnd I'm not talking Al Jazeera, I'm talking websites that are...\nasking for my head on a platter.\nOffering up the heavens and 40 virgins to anyone who will slit my throat from ear to ear.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHere, um...\n\n**Patient:**\nHere you are. It's not a recent photo. It's a photo taken when I was 18.\nOn a high-school trip to Europe, Holland.\nThat city with the miniatures. Ult... Utrecht.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUtrecht.\n\n**Patient:**\nRight.\nSo while I'm talking to you, a million fanatics are downloading my portrait and printing it out as a dartboard.\nSilly motherfuckers.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo, why have you come to see me?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhoa, whoa. We'll get to that.\nSo you're probably thinking, \"What's it like?\n\"He flew his mission, then he flew back \"and he saw the bodies of those children on CNN.\" You're probably trying to figure out what went through his head.\nLet me tell you, after that kind of mission, I don't watch CNN.\nI go to sleep.\nI'm dead tired.\nAnd you're probably dying to ask how I can sleep nights.\nOK, um...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow do you sleep?\n\n**Patient:**\nI sleep well, thank you very much, knowing it was mission accomplished and with great precision.\nI followed my orders, which were hit my target and hit it on time.\nTime and target. Do you know, we have to hit our targets within two seconds of the estimated time?\nIt's surgical. And that's one small window and I have never missed it.\nIf I had failed that task, I'd be in trouble with my superiors, with my conscience and with the system.\nBut I hit my target.\nSo, I sleep like a baby.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUm, h-how many...\nchildren...\ndied in this... in this mission?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe media puts it at 16.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd the air force?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe navy, Doctor, listen.\nThe navy says nothing and why should it?\nWe're not into body counts, we just hit targets.\nWe don't look back over our shoulder.\nWe do our thing so you can sit here in peace, talking to people for a living.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n So when did you hear that children had been killed?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe following afternoon. I heard it on the internet.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat exactly did you hear?\nAnything specifically that you remember?\n\n**Patient:**\nLike what? It's not like there's time in the day to be surfing the net, this was a moment, I got away.\nThere's a lot of stuff to keep me busy.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat kind of stuff?\n\n**Patient:**\nMission review, aerial photos, videos. Just data, stuff.\nPreparation versus execution.\nEvery tiny technical aspect of our flight is recorded and analysed by the man.\nThere's nowhere to hide. And that's the way it should be.\nIt's just stuff and more stuff.\nWhen my mother died, my father had a year's worth of stuff to deal with.\nLast will and testament, her office, garden, a lifetime of photo albums.\nAnd every time I talked to him, I'd ask how he was, expecting, uh...\nyou know, that... he'd break down.\nFinally.\n\"It never ends, Alex, it never ends. Your mother left such a mess.\n\"She didn't know she was gonna die.\" And that's all he said.\nAfter less than a year, he met another woman and got married, just like that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow did that make you feel?\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, surprised. A whole life together and not a single tear.\nMm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's interesting that you compare the death of your mother with this mission that you've just flown.\n\n**Patient:**\nThat's very clever of you.\nBut there's no relation whatsoever.\nMy mother's death was the most traumatic event in my life so far.\nThat mission was just another mission for Alex. There is no comparison.\nAnyway, look, that's over and I'm back now at my home base and now I'm on R&R.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat kind of things do you do for R&R?\n\n**Patient:**\nDon't try to get ahead of me.\nI'm a runner. I was a hell of a runner in high school and I'm still a good one for an old man.

I'm so totally not here.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou are very much here, Laura.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, it's not me that's here.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBelieve me, you'd be shocked to know the person that's sitting here.\n\n**Patient:**\nDid some...\nI did some terrible things last night.\n I feel sick.\nI don't wanna throw up.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoesn't matter, it's no big deal.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat do you mean?\nIt's vomit.

Why is he calling me here?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMaybe he's worried. You were out all night.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, right. If he really cared, he wouldn't have started with this shit.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nStart what?\n\n**Patient:**\nAt the club with this guy...\nOh, my God.\nHe had corduroy pants on, preppy sweater.\nRepublican probably.\n  Can I just step out for a second and let him know I'm here?\nI can't concentrate with this shit.\nJust a sec.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLaura, the call can wait.\n\n**Patient:**\n Andrew gave me an ultimatum.\nEither we get married or we split.\nSaid he wants an answer in a day or two at the most, or else he's out.\nSaid he can't take it any more.\nThat he loves me, that he doesn't believe I love him, not for real.\nThat it's been two years already, on and off, blah, blah, blah.\nI don't know why. All of a sudden, he just started ranting and raving.\nWe've talked about this stuff before, but it was all in theory if we stayed together, if.\nAnd suddenly out of the blue, I can't even remember what we were doing...\nWe were watching TV.\nAll of a sudden he just gets off the couch, grabs the remote and turns off the TV, and he turns to me and he has tears in his eyes and he says, \"That's it, I can't take it any more.\" So out of line. He promised he'd lay off the subject for a while.\nAnd all of a sudden he's on this crying bullshit.\nHe actually burst out crying. I've never seen him like that before.\nAnd to tell you the truth it really scared me.\nNo, it made me angry.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy?\n\n**Patient:**\nHe's trying to manipulate me with these cheap chick tricks.\nMaybe he thought he would break my heart or something.\nOr appeal to my...\nShit, you know, forget it, I don't know.\nI threw a tantrum like a three-year-old.\nI screamed, cried...\ntold him to fuck off...\ntold him he was a little piece of shit for doing this to me when he knows I'm working double shifts at the hospital this week.\nI slammed the door, smashed his laptop on the floor, I killed it, I ran out and I called Ilona.\nShe dressed me in this outfit.\nIt's, it's not mine.\nWe went out for a drink at a club that she likes on Chester Street.\nShe tried to calm me down, put things into perspective.\nAnd she said...\nShe said that I was lucky...\nthat she wished somebody had loved her enough to give her an ultimatum.\nAnd then we drank. Well, I drank.\nAnd there's this guy at the bar, and at some point Ilona said that she was tired and that she needed to go home.\nAnd then that guy...\nmoved next to me, and, erm...\nYou know what he said?\nHe said, \"You look so sad.\" And I said, \"Really?\" And he said, \"Yeah, you do. It looks good on you.\" \"Looks good on you.\" Whatever happened to, \"Do you have the time?\" or, \"Haven't we met before?\" I must be totally out of touch, Doctor.\nWhat do you think? I mean, do I look good when I'm sad?\nI don't think anybody looks good when they're sad.\nAnd then, er, I don't know how much I had to drink cos he was ordering for me, of course, and then he paid the bill and he asked me, \"Would you like to go somewhere else?\" And I said, \"Yes, I'd like to go to the bathroom.\" So I stood up and I went to the bathroom, he follows me.\nAnd you wouldn't believe it but these were unisex bathrooms.\nAm I unlucky or what?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow do you mean, unlucky?\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, I'm running away from a guy and I'm...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou were trying to get away from the guy.\n\n**Patient:**\nI mean, I needed to pee, by myself, I've been doing that since I was three.\nSo I realise I needed to make a decision.\nBy following me to the bathroom, this guy was also giving me an ultimatum.\nI thought, \"Fuck, out of the pan and into the fire.\" I ran away from one ultimatum, and there was this guy with a hard on giving me another.\nSuddenly I felt like doing it.\nI never had sex in a bathroom before.\nI mean, what, I should go and marry Andrew without ever knowing what a good bathroom fuck's all about?\nIt's part of a young lady's education, isn't it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you wanted to do it but not to get back at Andrew, just for yourself?\n\n**Patient:**\nThat's right.\nA girl being forced into marriage...\nwhat's she supposed to do, die ignorant?\nSo this guy follows me into the stall and...\nsuddenly...\nI was horny.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs hearing about this disgusting to you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. It's not disgusting.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nGo on.\n\n**Patient:**\nHe unzipped, pulled down his pants, and he stood there with this...\nhuge...\nOh, God, I felt like I was 16...\ntouching it for the very first time.\nI was really surprised at how...\nwarm it felt.\nI mean, don't I know that already?\nAnd then he turned me round to face the door...\nand he pulled down my stockings.\nHe lifted up my skirt, put his hand into his back pocket and pulled out a condom.\nI realise this guy's very good at this, he does this a lot, he's a real pro.\nAnd then this guy entered the stall next to us and started peeing, and gushes full volume like a racehorse.\nAnd I thought of Andrew...\nhow... how he pees in the morning, making the same sound.\nMy heart ached, I just...\nIt was so stupid, you know, I just felt so sad all of a sudden, and then he's behind me and he's rubbing up against me and he's feeling me up.\nAnd I thought to myself, \"It's gonna happen any moment now,\" and I just...\nI just couldn't do it.\nI simply closed my legs shut. I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it to Andrew.\nI just couldn't do it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, seems like quite a night out.\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, yeah, that's not the end of it, because this idiot, I told him, \"I'm really sorry but I have a boyfriend, I can't do this.\" And he says, \"Boo-hoo,\" and he grabs my hands and he says, \"Listen, cupcake, you think you can leave me high and dry like this?\" Pointing at his dick.\n\"The least you can do is make it up to me.\" I said to him, \"What do you want? You want some money?\" He said, \"Give me a hand job \"and there'll be no hard feelings.\" And I said to him, \"What's the matter with you? Are you crazy?\" And it was just getting really strange. It was tense. His tone changed.\nAnd then...\nAnd then I thought of you.\nWhat you'd say about it.\nI thought about us going through this in therapy.\nAnd what did you imagine us saying?\nI imagined you not being able to understand it.\nThat you'd be disgusted.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs that why you ran over here?\nTo find out if I would be disgusted?\n\n**Patient:**\nI didn't run.\nI gave him the hand job.\nGod. Excuse me.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n You OK?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. Yeah, I'm fine.\n Yeah.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThank you.\n\n**Patient:**\nWe, erm...\nWe talked about what happened at the, er, the club last night but we never got back to actually talking about Andrew and that argument yesterday.\nI don't wanna be put in this position.\nI don't wanna have this power to decide our future for both of us. I just don't.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you have any idea why Andrew chose this particular time?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat do you mean?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you think that Andrew, just out of the blue, as you said yourself, came up with this idea of an ultimatum?\nDid you notice anything over the last couple of days or weeks that you think might have brought this on?\n\n**Patient:**\nNothing, I don't know. He just lost it.\nShit, don't you know that men are the new women?\nObsessed with weddings and children. And lately he's lost touch with reality.\nHe thinks I'm seeing someone. That's how this whole thing started. It's unbelievable.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI thought you said it came out of nowhere.\nYou were watching TV and then suddenly...\n\n**Patient:**\nWe were watching TV but, before that, we were having dinner and he had this look on his face, this sad look, and I could tell something was up. You can just tell, right?\nAnd I said to him, \"What's going on?\" And he said, \"I don't know what I want, \"I just know I don't want this on-and-off thing.\" So I said to him, \"Sure.\" And then, \"Let's just decide, either we get married or we split.\"\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you were the one who came up with it.\n\n**Patient:**\nWith what?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe ultimatum.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, he's the one.\nHe had the problem with the on-and-off thing.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYeah, but on and off can mean several things.\nYou were the one who made it specific get married or to split up, that was your ultimatum.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, no, no, he had this thing with this on and o...\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

It's a therapist's joke.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo, do you recognise me?\nNo.\nI'm sorry, uh, should I?\nI was told you were the best, a man in tune with everything around him,\nso you should.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThank you.\nBut I do think that in this profession, \"the best\" is really a matter of personal opinion.\nNo, the best can be established by facts and figures.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou're the best. I did my research.\nCouple of former patients, someone who knew you from graduate school.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoes that pressure you?\nIs it important for you to know\nthat I am the best?\n\n**Patient:**\nYes.\nIt's nothing personal, I always go to the best - dentists, mechanics.\nYou know what they say - save now, pay later.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what do you think being the best therapist entails?\n\n**Patient:**\nDo you recognise me?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, I...\nI... I don't.\n\n**Patient:**\nLet me help.\nThe Madrasah Murderer.\nDoes that mean anything to you?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt wasn't that long ago.\nUS Navy aircraft hit a target on the outskirts of Baghdad.\nNaval Intelligence identified the structure as an insurgents' safe house, a bunker. Turns out it's a madrasah.\nLet me tell you what that is. It's an Islamic religious school.\nBoys like bees in a beehive studying the Koran.\n16 of them... dead.\nRings a bell?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes, I remember that, yes.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo, that's me.\nI flew that mission.\nThe Madrasah Murderer.\nSo, uh, do you surf the net?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, somehow... Well, it wasn't really somehow, it was...\n\n**Patient:**\nLet's call a spade a spade. A leak. Probably another intelligence fuck-up.\nAnyway, I was identified as the pilot in that mission and my photo was placed on fundamentalist websites.\nAnd I'm not talking Al Jazeera, I'm talking websites that are...\nasking for my head on a platter.\nOffering up the heavens and 40 virgins to anyone who will slit my throat from ear to ear.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHere, um...\n\n**Patient:**\nHere you are. It's not a recent photo. It's a photo taken when I was 18.\nOn a high-school trip to Europe, Holland.\nThat city with the miniatures. Ult... Utrecht.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUtrecht.\n\n**Patient:**\nRight.\nSo while I'm talking to you, a million fanatics are downloading my portrait and printing it out as a dartboard.\nSilly motherfuckers.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo, why have you come to see me?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhoa, whoa. We'll get to that.\nSo you're probably thinking, \"What's it like?\n\"He flew his mission, then he flew back \"and he saw the bodies of those children on CNN.\" You're probably trying to figure out what went through his head.\nLet me tell you, after that kind of mission, I don't watch CNN.\nI go to sleep.\nI'm dead tired.\nAnd you're probably dying to ask how I can sleep nights.\nOK, um...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow do you sleep?\n\n**Patient:**\nI sleep well, thank you very much, knowing it was mission accomplished and with great precision.\nI followed my orders, which were hit my target and hit it on time.\nTime and target. Do you know, we have to hit our targets within two seconds of the estimated time?\nIt's surgical. And that's one small window and I have never missed it.\nIf I had failed that task, I'd be in trouble with my superiors, with my conscience and with the system.\nBut I hit my target.\nSo, I sleep like a baby.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUm, h-how many...\nchildren...\ndied in this... in this mission?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe media puts it at 16.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd the air force?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe navy, Doctor, listen.\nThe navy says nothing and why should it?\nWe're not into body counts, we just hit targets.\nWe don't look back over our shoulder.\nWe do our thing so you can sit here in peace, talking to people for a living.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n So when did you hear that children had been killed?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe following afternoon. I heard it on the internet.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat exactly did you hear?\nAnything specifically that you remember?\n\n**Patient:**\nLike what? It's not like there's time in the day to be surfing the net, this was a moment, I got away.\nThere's a lot of stuff to keep me busy.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat kind of stuff?\n\n**Patient:**\nMission review, aerial photos, videos. Just data, stuff.\nPreparation versus execution.\nEvery tiny technical aspect of our flight is recorded and analysed by the man.\nThere's nowhere to hide. And that's the way it should be.\nIt's just stuff and more stuff.\nWhen my mother died, my father had a year's worth of stuff to deal with.\nLast will and testament, her office, garden, a lifetime of photo albums.\nAnd every time I talked to him, I'd ask how he was, expecting, uh...\nyou know, that... he'd break down.\nFinally.\n\"It never ends, Alex, it never ends. Your mother left such a mess.\n\"She didn't know she was gonna die.\" And that's all he said.\nAfter less than a year, he met another woman and got married, just like that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow did that make you feel?\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, surprised. A whole life together and not a single tear.\nMm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's interesting that you compare the death of your mother with this mission that you've just flown.\n\n**Patient:**\nThat's very clever of you.\nBut there's no relation whatsoever.\nMy mother's death was the most traumatic event in my life so far.\nThat mission was just another mission for Alex. There is no comparison.\nAnyway, look, that's over and I'm back now at my home base and now I'm on R&R.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat kind of things do you do for R&R?\n\n**Patient:**\nDon't try to get ahead of me.\nI'm a runner. I was a hell of a runner in high school and I'm still a good one for an old man. So, I run with my fairy friend.\nThis gay guy who could kick your ass at any sport.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd does he have a name, this friend?\n\n**Patient:**\nMm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDaniel.\n\n**Patient:**\nDaniel.\nWe've been running together for a long time, between six and ten miles.\nDepending on whether one of us is on his period. Only this time, I challenged him.\nIt was no good running in the Middle East, not for the US military, unless you want a bomb to blow your balls off!\nSo, I wanted to do some serious running. I said, \"Let's go for 15.\" After 15 miles, I said, \"20.\" He didn't want it.\nI said, \"OK, I'll go on my own.\" So, he followed.\nI said, \"You know, only six more and it's a marathon. Let's do it.\" He wanted to stop. Little bitch.\nBut I wasn't gonna stop.\nNo stop.\nWe were out of water, we were on fumes.\nAt 22 miles, I had a heart attack and died.\nA textbook case, straight out of med school.\nEnlargement of the left ventricle, in accordance with the family history on both sides, fatal.\nAccording to the EKG and according to statistics, I had a 97.3 per cent chance of dying.\nOr a 2.7 per cent chance of living. Anyway, dead.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou actually died?\n\n**Patient:**\nIn the clinical sense no pulse, no brain activity, total clinical death.\nBut here I am.\nNow I'm gonna disappoint you, Doctor.\nWanna know why I'm gonna disappoint you?\nLet me help you - the light, the tunnel, life flashing before my eyes.\nThat's what you're interested in, right?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, I wasn't actually thinking of that at all, but I am interested.\nTell me.\n\n**Patient:**\nI couldn't give a shit about it either.\nBut that's all everyone wanted to know about - my father, my wife.\nEveryone wanted to hear about the goddamn tunnel.\nJust such bullshit.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you feel that maybe you disappointed people by not having that experience?\nThat maybe in some way you failed to deliver the goods?\n\n**Patient:**\nNobody really knows what was going through my mind during those last few moments.\nAs soon as there was no more tunnel, no one was interested.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd what was going through your mind?\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, I knew what was happening, you can tell.\nAnd you're afraid it's the end.\nIn all that time until I lost consciousness...\nAll that time... I don't know, it was maybe seconds, maybe half a minute.\nAll that time I kept trying to figure out if I had a hard-on.\nI don't know how I remembered, it was something my grandmother told me, when I was in high school, and she said when Grandpa died, she found him lying naked in the bathtub with a huge erection.\nNow, he's... he was 92 years old.\nShe hadn't seen an erection like that in 20 years.\nShe liked it. She said that was God's final gift to a man.\nA dead man's boner. They call it angel lust.\nAnyway, I'm lying there thinking about that story.\nI know what's happening and I said to myself, \"God Almighty, just don't let me have an erection now, not a hard-on.\" Because if you had an erection, it would mean...\nThat would mean that I was dead.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd your friend Daniel was with you throughout this?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, resuscitation, CPR... Daniel's a doctor. I forgot to say that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh. For a minute I thought you were going to say something else, that perhaps your fear of an erection was associated with the presence of your friend, Daniel.\n\n**Patient:**\nExcuse me?\nYou're exaggerating. I explained something simple, a dead man's erection - what's that got to do with Daniel?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, maybe I didn't make myself clear earlier on when I was talking about the customer always being wrong.\nWhat I meant was that sometimes the patient hides things from his therapist, from himself.\nAnd so part of our job is to uncover the things that we hide.\n\n**Patient:**\n So, my secret is I'm afraid of homosexuals?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, not necessarily. But I just wanted to clarify that.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, that's neither here nor there. I want to get to my point.\nI didn't have the erection, so relax.\nBut I remember very vividly that moment just before passing out, before losing consciousness.\nLosing consciousness, that's a funny expression.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy do you think that's a funny expression?\n\n**Patient:**\nLosing consciousness - it's an expression my father would use.\nEverything in terms of profits and loss.\nFits him like a glove.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo something about how you describe your last moments is equated with your father's seeing things in terms of profit and loss?\n\n**Patient:**\nOK, OK, with all due respect, I think we've come to this way too early.\nThe father-son relationship stuff shouldn't come up so soon.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou think it's too soon?\n\n**Patient:**\nForget what I feel.\nI know it's too soon. I wanna know what you think.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you're... You're testing me?\n\n**Patient:**\nI'm entitled to some testing. I'm paying.\nActually, I think you've been testing me since you walked in.\nYou've asked about me and my reputation, you ask, you practically demand that I ask certain questions that you think I am dying to ask.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's important to you, I think, that I adhere to certain standards you set before you walked through the door.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat's wrong with that? Look, I did my research.\nIt's a 1  1/2 hour drive to get here and I'm paying you good money.\nAnd I'm expected to tell you, a perfect stranger, the most intimate things about my life.\nPlus there are risks here.\nIt's not like the navy's gonna give me a medal for spilling my guts, I'm not gonna open up to you without knowing what you are.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd what do you expect to find, Alex?\nHow are we going to know that I'm a good enough therapist for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nI'll know...\naccording to your opinion.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMy opinion of what?\n\n**Patient:**\nOf the issue I came to talk about.\nBut I'll come to that in a minute.\nIt's to do with what happened after taking me out of the freezer.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe freezer?\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, you mean that you were grounded?\nNo, literally frozen. They froze me.\nThe mobile intensive care unit arrived and put me in a suit that freezes you.\nThey got one no more than three-quarters of a mile from where I collapsed.\nAnd their ER is tops.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLet's go back to this...\n\n**Patient:**\nWe're getting there. You have no patience.\nI was told you're a good listener.\nNow look, it works on a very simple principle.\nIt reduces the shock to the body's systems by dropping the body temperature.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo how long were you...\n\n**Patient:**\nIn my case, 48 hours. It's a record.\nThere's no history of anyone who's been in that suit for such a long time.\nI guess I went a long way up that tunnel.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe tunnel that wasn't there?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, unfortunately not.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo tell me what you remember about this 48 hours.\n\n**Patient:**\nMostly I remember, um... a terrible fatigue.\nI guess that's why they call it \"dead tired\".\nIt's physical, but mainly mental exhaustion.\nAnd I remember very clearly the relief I felt when I succeeded in coming back over into the \nworld.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou say that you succeeded in coming back to this world.\nDid... Did you feel it was under your control?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat are you trying to get at?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'm not trying to get at anything.\nBut what you're describing is a strong will to live.\n\n**Patient:**\nDuring this experience, there was a decision to go on living.\nYeah, I guess you're right.\nDespite having made this effort to live...\neverybody's disappointed.\nIt's not every day people meet someone who's come back from the dead.\nIt's a one-in-a-million thing. And if you don't supply the goods, then...\nListen, I have never spent a day in my life in a hospital.\nYou get it? Never.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo, perhaps your anger isn't directed at those people interested in the tunnel.\nPerhaps you're angry at yourself, Alex. How your body betrayed you.\nThis is a systems failure that was not supposed to happen to somebody like you.\n\n**Patient:**\nHmh.\nI have a brother, who's not bright, he's a real-estate agent.\nAnyway, he's a great athlete. And he once proved to me, and he does his research, believe me...\nthat all the great quarterbacks in the history of football were also the best looking.\nNamath, Staubach, Cunningham, they're all good-Iooking people.\nThe best-Iooking students in the class are often great athletes.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou know why that is?\n\n**Patient:**\nI've no idea.\nIt's got nothing to do with sports.\nWhen they got their gift from God the Father, or whoever the hell doles out the talent, they got the whole package - beauty, talent, character.\nThat's how it is. It's an evolutionary thing.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo, how is your football?\n\n**Patient:**\nNah.\nFootball's not my game. Running, of course.\nWrestling. Pole vault, once upon a time.\nBut now, I am part of a military elite.\nAthletes may be popular, but we are the creme de la creme.\nYou have to understand, this is a person whose whole life was perfect.\nPeople in my line of work are born to excel, to be perfect.\nIt wasn't our choice, it was life that chose us to be the best.\nAnd what does that mean? \"Life chose us?\" Yeah, you don't become a fighter pilot suddenly at age 20.\nAt age seven or eight, when you're in the third grade, you know you're talented.\nYou know you're headed somewhere special, you are going to be the best and it all lays out right in front of you.\nTop grades, varsity letters, you name it.\nI'm a TOPGUN grad, you understand that? That training is not for pussies.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo if you don't achieve your personal best,\nare you disappointed in yourself?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, no, that's not...\nHow much longer do we have?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWe've got time. I'II...\nI'll tell you when it's... when it's time.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK, so here's my point, finally.\nI came to get your advice on something.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSure.\n\n**Patient:**\nI decided to go there. To the target.\nYou understand what I'm talking about here?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou mean to the site where you dropped the bomb, to the school?\n\n**Patient:**\nMadrasah. I wanna go back, take a look around.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhere the children were killed?\n\n**Patient:**\nI know what you're thinking, so let me straighten this out.\nI don't have a guilty conscience, I already told you that. I sleep very well.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBut why would you want to go back?\n\n**Patient:**\nI'm interested.\nFrom the moment I came out of that freezer, I knew I wanted to go back.\nIt came up in a conversation I had with Daniel when he visited me at the hospital.\nHe thinks I'm gonna freak out or something, he thinks it's a crazy thing to do.\nAnd he said I need to see someone first - psychologist, psychiatrist.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDon't you think it's dangerous?\n\n**Patient:**\nNot at all.\nI don't think anyone would recognise me.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBut your picture's on the internet.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo way. You saw the picture.\nIt's ridiculous. My mother wouldn't recognise me, not even Michaela.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWho's Michaela?\n\n**Patient:**\nMy wife.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat does she think of all this?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat's she got to do with it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDon't you talk with your wife?\n\n**Patient:**\nThis is not for me, all this \"What do you feel? What do you think?\" I asked you something, I came to you to consult about something specific.\nSo, you want me to tell you that this desire of yours to go back to where the bombing took place is a good thing?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOK, yeah, yeah. Yes.\nDo you want me to take responsibility for this visit?\n\n**Patient:**\nOK, don't make me into an idiot. Are you telling me I'm not taking responsibility?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, I'm just going back to something you said earlier on.\nRemember you said that life chose you to be a member of an elite, that it wasn't your decision?\nMaybe that's an attitude you're comfortable with.\nYou're comfortable with it because you don't have to make any decisions.\nIt relieves you of responsibility.\nYour commanding officer, he makes the decisions, conveys them to you and you execute them.\n\n**Patient:**\nWait, are you trying to tell me that I'm asking you to be my commanding officer?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOK, I'll buy it.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo, are you willing to... to be my CO?\nFor $150 an hour.\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

Anyway, dead.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou actually died?\n\n**Patient:**\nIn the clinical sense no pulse, no brain activity, total clinical death.\nBut here I am.\nNow I'm gonna disappoint you, Doctor.\nWanna know why I'm gonna disappoint you?\nLet me help you - the light, the tunnel, life flashing before my eyes.\nThat's what you're interested in, right?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, I wasn't actually thinking of that at all, but I am interested.\nTell me.\n\n**Patient:**\nI couldn't give a shit about it either.\nBut that's all everyone wanted to know about - my father, my wife.\nEveryone wanted to hear about the goddamn tunnel.\nJust such bullshit.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you feel that maybe you disappointed people by not having that experience?\nThat maybe in some way you failed to deliver the goods?\n\n**Patient:**\nNobody really knows what was going through my mind during those last few moments.\nAs soon as there was no more tunnel, no one was interested.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd what was going through your mind?\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, I knew what was happening, you can tell.\nAnd you're afraid it's the end.\nIn all that time until I lost consciousness...\nAll that time... I don't know, it was maybe seconds, maybe half a minute.\nAll that time I kept trying to figure out if I had a hard-on.\nI don't know how I remembered, it was something my grandmother told me, when I was in high school, and she said when Grandpa died, she found him lying naked in the bathtub with a huge erection.\nNow, he's... he was 92 years old.\nShe hadn't seen an erection like that in 20 years.\nShe liked it. She said that was God's final gift to a man.\nA dead man's boner. They call it angel lust.\nAnyway, I'm lying there thinking about that story.\nI know what's happening and I said to myself, \"God Almighty, just don't let me have an erection now, not a hard-on.\" Because if you had an erection, it would mean...\nThat would mean that I was dead.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd your friend Daniel was with you throughout this?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, resuscitation, CPR... Daniel's a doctor. I forgot to say that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh. For a minute I thought you were going to say something else, that perhaps your fear of an erection was associated with the presence of your friend, Daniel.\n\n**Patient:**\nExcuse me?\nYou're exaggerating. I explained something simple, a dead man's erection - what's that got to do with Daniel?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, maybe I didn't make myself clear earlier on when I was talking about the customer always being wrong.\nWhat I meant was that sometimes the patient hides things from his therapist, from himself.\nAnd so part of our job is to uncover the things that we hide.\n\n**Patient:**\n So, my secret is I'm afraid of homosexuals?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, not necessarily. But I just wanted to clarify that.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, that's neither here nor there. I want to get to my point.\nI didn't have the erection, so relax.\nBut I remember very vividly that moment just before passing out, before losing consciousness.\nLosing consciousness, that's a funny expression.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy do you think that's a funny expression?\n\n**Patient:**\nLosing consciousness - it's an expression my father would use.\nEverything in terms of profits and loss.\nFits him like a glove.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo something about how you describe your last moments is equated with your father's seeing things in terms of profit and loss?\n\n**Patient:**\nOK, OK, with all due respect, I think we've come to this way too early.\nThe father-son relationship stuff shouldn't come up so soon.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou think it's too soon?\n\n**Patient:**\nForget what I feel.\nI know it's too soon. I wanna know what you think.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you're... You're testing me?\n\n**Patient:**\nI'm entitled to some testing. I'm paying.\nActually, I think you've been testing me since you walked in.\nYou've asked about me and my reputation, you ask, you practically demand that I ask certain questions that you think I am dying to ask.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's important to you, I think, that I adhere to certain standards you set before you walked through the door.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat's wrong with that? Look, I did my research.\nIt's a 1  1/2 hour drive to get here and I'm paying you good money.\nAnd I'm expected to tell you, a perfect stranger, the most intimate things about my life.\nPlus there are risks here.\nIt's not like the navy's gonna give me a medal for spilling my guts, I'm not gonna open up to you without knowing what you are.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd what do you expect to find, Alex?\nHow are we going to know that I'm a good enough therapist for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nI'll know...\naccording to your opinion.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMy opinion of what?\n\n**Patient:**\nOf the issue I came to talk about.\nBut I'll come to that in a minute.\nIt's to do with what happened after taking me out of the freezer.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe freezer?\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, you mean that you were grounded?\nNo, literally frozen. They froze me.\nThe mobile intensive care unit arrived and put me in a suit that freezes you.\nThey got one no more than three-quarters of a mile from where I collapsed.\nAnd their ER is tops.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLet's go back to this...\n\n**Patient:**\nWe're getting there. You have no patience.\nI was told you're a good listener.\nNow look, it works on a very simple principle.\nIt reduces the shock to the body's systems by dropping the body temperature.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo how long were you...\n\n**Patient:**\nIn my case, 48 hours. It's a record.\nThere's no history of anyone who's been in that suit for such a long time.\nI guess I went a long way up that tunnel.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe tunnel that wasn't there?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, unfortunately not.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo tell me what you remember about this 48 hours.\n\n**Patient:**\nMostly I remember, um... a terrible fatigue.\nI guess that's why they call it \"dead tired\".\nIt's physical, but mainly mental exhaustion.\nAnd I remember very clearly the relief I felt when I succeeded in coming back over into the \nworld.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou say that you succeeded in coming back to this world.\nDid... Did you feel it was under your control?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat are you trying to get at?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'm not trying to get at anything.\nBut what you're describing is a strong will to live.\n\n**Patient:**\nDuring this experience, there was a decision to go on living.\nYeah, I guess you're right.\nDespite having made this effort to live...\neverybody's disappointed.\nIt's not every day people meet someone who's come back from the dead.\nIt's a one-in-a-million thing. And if you don't supply the goods, then...\nListen, I have never spent a day in my life in a hospital.\nYou get it? Never.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo, perhaps your anger isn't directed at those people interested in the tunnel.\nPerhaps you're angry at yourself, Alex. How your body betrayed you.\nThis is a systems failure that was not supposed to happen to somebody like you.\n\n**Patient:**\nHmh.\nI have a brother, who's not bright, he's a real-estate agent.\nAnyway, he's a great athlete. And he once proved to me, and he does his research, believe me...\nthat all the great quarterbacks in the history of football were also the best looking.\nNamath, Staubach, Cunningham, they're all good-Iooking people.\nThe best-Iooking students in the class are often great athletes.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou know why that is?\n\n**Patient:**\nI've no idea.\nIt's got nothing to do with sports.\nWhen they got their gift from God the Father, or whoever the hell doles out the talent, they got the whole package - beauty, talent, character.\nThat's how it is. It's an evolutionary thing.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo, how is your football?\n\n**Patient:**\nNah.\nFootball's not my game. Running, of course.\nWrestling. Pole vault, once upon a time.\nBut now, I am part of a military elite.\nAthletes may be popular, but we are the creme de la creme.\nYou have to understand, this is a person whose whole life was perfect.\nPeople in my line of work are born to excel, to be perfect.\nIt wasn't our choice, it was life that chose us to be the best.\nAnd what does that mean? \"Life chose us?\" Yeah, you don't become a fighter pilot suddenly at age 20.\nAt age seven or eight, when you're in the third grade, you know you're talented.\nYou know you're headed somewhere special, you are going to be the best and it all lays out right in front of you.\nTop grades, varsity letters, you name it.\nI'm a TOPGUN grad, you understand that? That training is not for pussies.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo if you don't achieve your personal best,\nare you disappointed in yourself?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, no, that's not...\nHow much longer do we have?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWe've got time. I'II...\nI'll tell you when it's... when it's time.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK, so here's my point, finally.\nI came to get your advice on something.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSure.\n\n**Patient:**\nI decided to go there. To the target.\nYou understand what I'm talking about here?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou mean to the site where you dropped the bomb, to the school?\n\n**Patient:**\nMadrasah. I wanna go back, take a look around.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhere the children were killed?\n\n**Patient:**\nI know what you're thinking, so let me straighten this out.\nI don't have a guilty conscience, I already told you that. I sleep very well.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBut why would you want to go back?\n\n**Patient:**\nI'm interested.\nFrom the moment I came out of that freezer, I knew I wanted to go back.\nIt came up in a conversation I had with Daniel when he visited me at the hospital.\nHe thinks I'm gonna freak out or something, he thinks it's a crazy thing to do.\nAnd he said I need to see someone first - psychologist, psychiatrist.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDon't you think it's dangerous?\n\n**Patient:**\nNot at all.\nI don't think anyone would recognise me.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBut your picture's on the internet.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo way. You saw the picture.\nIt's ridiculous. My mother wouldn't recognise me, not even Michaela.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWho's Michaela?\n\n**Patient:**\nMy wife.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat does she think of all this?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat's she got to do with it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDon't you talk with your wife?\n\n**Patient:**\nThis is not for me, all this \"What do you feel? What do you think?\" I asked you something, I came to you to consult about something specific.\nSo, you want me to tell you that this desire of yours to go back to where the bombing took place is a good thing?\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

I shouldn't have come.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou should have come here.\nWhat happened last night?\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, what didn't happen?\nWant the long version or the bottom line?\nBecause the bottom line's very simple.\nMy life is over.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThen you'd better tell me the long version.\n\n**Patient:**\nI left Andrew. We had a big blowout screaming, crying, the works.\nThen at some point, I called Ilona, and we went out for a drink, and...\nwe had a few drinks.\nListen, I'm not here. I'm so totally not here.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou are very much here, Laura.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, it's not me that's here.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBelieve me, you'd be shocked to know the person that's sitting here.\n\n**Patient:**\nDid some...\nI did some terrible things last night.\n I feel sick.\nI don't wanna throw up.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoesn't matter, it's no big deal.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat do you mean?\nIt's vomit. I'm not gonna vomit all over your rug.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's a cheap rug, Laura.\nLet's talk about what's really going on here.\nHm?\n\n**Patient:**\n  It's Andrew. He knows I'm here at this time. Why is he calling me here?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMaybe he's worried. You were out all night.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, right. If he really cared, he wouldn't have started with this shit.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nStart what?\n\n**Patient:**\nAt the club with this guy...\nOh, my God.\nHe had corduroy pants on, preppy sweater.\nRepublican probably.\n  Can I just step out for a second and let him know I'm here?\nI can't concentrate with this shit.\nJust a sec.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLaura, the call can wait.\n\n**Patient:**\n Andrew gave me an ultimatum.\nEither we get married or we split.\nSaid he wants an answer in a day or two at the most, or else he's out.\nSaid he can't take it any more.\nThat he loves me, that he doesn't believe I love him, not for real.\nThat it's been two years already, on and off, blah, blah, blah.\nI don't know why. All of a sudden, he just started ranting and raving.\nWe've talked about this stuff before, but it was all in theory if we stayed together, if.\nAnd suddenly out of the blue, I can't even remember what we were doing...\nWe were watching TV.\nAll of a sudden he just gets off the couch, grabs the remote and turns off the TV, and he turns to me and he has tears in his eyes and he says, \"That's it, I can't take it any more.\" So out of line. He promised he'd lay off the subject for a while.\nAnd all of a sudden he's on this crying bullshit.\nHe actually burst out crying. I've never seen him like that before.\nAnd to tell you the truth it really scared me.\nNo, it made me angry.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy?\n\n**Patient:**\nHe's trying to manipulate me with these cheap chick tricks.\nMaybe he thought he would break my heart or something.\nOr appeal to my...\nShit, you know, forget it, I don't know.\nI threw a tantrum like a three-year-old.\nI screamed, cried...\ntold him to fuck off...\ntold him he was a little piece of shit for doing this to me when he knows I'm working double shifts at the hospital this week.\nI slammed the door, smashed his laptop on the floor, I killed it, I ran out and I called Ilona.\nShe dressed me in this outfit.\nIt's, it's not mine.\nWe went out for a drink at a club that she likes on Chester Street.\nShe tried to calm me down, put things into perspective.\nAnd she said...\nShe said that I was lucky...\nthat she wished somebody had loved her enough to give her an ultimatum.\nAnd then we drank. Well, I drank.\nAnd there's this guy at the bar, and at some point Ilona said that she was tired and that she needed to go home.\nAnd then that guy...\nmoved next to me, and, erm...\nYou know what he said?\nHe said, \"You look so sad.\" And I said, \"Really?\" And he said, \"Yeah, you do. It looks good on you.\" \"Looks good on you.\" Whatever happened to, \"Do you have the time?\" or, \"Haven't we met before?\" I must be totally out of touch, Doctor.\nWhat do you think? I mean, do I look good when I'm sad?\nI don't think anybody looks good when they're sad.\nAnd then, er, I don't know how much I had to drink cos he was ordering for me, of course, and then he paid the bill and he asked me, \"Would you like to go somewhere else?\" And I said, \"Yes, I'd like to go to the bathroom.\" So I stood up and I went to the bathroom, he follows me.\nAnd you wouldn't believe it but these were unisex bathrooms.\nAm I unlucky or what?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow do you mean, unlucky?\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, I'm running away from a guy and I'm...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou were trying to get away from the guy.\n\n**Patient:**\nI mean, I needed to pee, by myself, I've been doing that since I was three.\nSo I realise I needed to make a decision.\nBy following me to the bathroom, this guy was also giving me an ultimatum.\nI thought, \"Fuck, out of the pan and into the fire.\" I ran away from one ultimatum, and there was this guy with a hard on giving me another.\nSuddenly I felt like doing it.\nI never had sex in a bathroom before.\nI mean, what, I should go and marry Andrew without ever knowing what a good bathroom fuck's all about?\nIt's part of a young lady's education, isn't it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you wanted to do it but not to get back at Andrew, just for yourself?\n\n**Patient:**\nThat's right.\nA girl being forced into marriage...\nwhat's she supposed to do, die ignorant?\nSo this guy follows me into the stall and...\nsuddenly...\nI was horny.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs hearing about this disgusting to you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. It's not disgusting.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nGo on.\n\n**Patient:**\nHe unzipped, pulled down his pants, and he stood there with this...\nhuge...\nOh, God, I felt like I was 16...\ntouching it for the very first time.\nI was really surprised at how...\nwarm it felt.\nI mean, don't I know that already?\nAnd then he turned me round to face the door...\nand he pulled down my stockings.\nHe lifted up my skirt, put his hand into his back pocket and pulled out a condom.\nI realise this guy's very good at this, he does this a lot, he's a real pro.\nAnd then this guy entered the stall next to us and started peeing, and gushes full volume like a racehorse.\nAnd I thought of Andrew...\nhow... how he pees in the morning, making the same sound.\nMy heart ached, I just...\nIt was so stupid, you know, I just felt so sad all of a sudden, and then he's behind me and he's rubbing up against me and he's feeling me up.\nAnd I thought to myself, \"It's gonna happen any moment now,\" and I just...\nI just couldn't do it.\nI simply closed my legs shut. I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it to Andrew.\nI just couldn't do it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, seems like quite a night out.\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, yeah, that's not the end of it, because this idiot, I told him, \"I'm really sorry but I have a boyfriend, I can't do this.\" And he says, \"Boo-hoo,\" and he grabs my hands and he says, \"Listen, cupcake, you think you can leave me high and dry like this?\" Pointing at his dick.\n\"The least you can do is make it up to me.\" I said to him, \"What do you want? You want some money?\" He said, \"Give me a hand job \"and there'll be no hard feelings.\" And I said to him, \"What's the matter with you? Are you crazy?\" And it was just getting really strange. It was tense. His tone changed.\nAnd then...\nAnd then I thought of you.\nWhat you'd say about it.\nI thought about us going through this in therapy.\nAnd what did you imagine us saying?\nI imagined you not being able to understand it.\nThat you'd be disgusted.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs that why you ran over here?\nTo find out if I would be disgusted?\n\n**Patient:**\nI didn't run.\nI gave him the hand job.\nGod. Excuse me.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n You OK?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. Yeah, I'm fine.\n Yeah.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThank you.\n\n**Patient:**\nWe, erm...\nWe talked about what happened at the, er, the club last night but we never got back to actually talking about Andrew and that argument yesterday.\nI don't wanna be put in this position.\nI don't wanna have this power to decide our future for both of us. I just don't.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you have any idea why Andrew chose this particular time?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat do you mean?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you think that Andrew, just out of the blue, as you said yourself, came up with this idea of an ultimatum?\nDid you notice anything over the last couple of days or weeks that you think might have brought this on?\n\n**Patient:**\nNothing, I don't know. He just lost it.\nShit, don't you know that men are the new women?\nObsessed with weddings and children. And lately he's lost touch with reality.\nHe thinks I'm seeing someone. That's how this whole thing started. It's unbelievable.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI thought you said it came out of nowhere.\nYou were watching TV and then suddenly...\n\n**Patient:**\nWe were watching TV but, before that, we were having dinner and he had this look on his face, this sad look, and I could tell something was up. You can just tell, right?\nAnd I said to him, \"What's going on?\" And he said, \"I don't know what I want, \"I just know I don't want this on-and-off thing.\" So I said to him, \"Sure.\" And then, \"Let's just decide, either we get married or we split.\"\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you were the one who came up with it.\n\n**Patient:**\nWith what?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe ultimatum.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, he's the one.\nHe had the problem with the on-and-off thing.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYeah, but on and off can mean several things.\nYou were the one who made it specific get married or to split up, that was your ultimatum.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, no, no, he had this thing with this on and o...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe ultim...\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, OK. I was the first one to say it, you're right.\nBut he jumped all over it. I said I didn't know what I want and he said, \"You have a day or two max to decide what you want.\" And I said, \"Fine.\" And then he started crying and blah, blah, blah.\nThe whole thing was scary to him, I think.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat about you? Weren't you scared?\n\n**Patient:**\nOf what?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOf splitting up.\n\n**Patient:**\nI wasn't suggesting that we split up. That's not the point.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what do you think was the point of this argument that you may have initiated?\n\n**Patient:**\nI didn't initiate anything.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, you may not have meant to, but you did.\nIt sounds like you wanted to bring this relationship into crisis.\nI know you say that Andrew hates uncertainties but perhaps you're the one who can't live with them.\nWhy did you choose this particular time to bring things to a head?\n\n**Patient:**\nI did no such thing.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy now?\n\n**Patient:**\nCos he's right.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAndrew's right.\n\n**Patient:**\nI am being unfaithful to him.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou mean what happened last night at the club?\n\n**Patient:**\nNot just last night.\nI've been unfaithful to him for a long time.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo, why haven't we talked about this before?\n\n**Patient:**\nI think we have.\nIt's been here all along.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou mean to say you've never noticed it?\n\n**Patient:**\nYou're surprised.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, I'm not surprised, I just... I don't follow what you mean.\n\n**Patient:**\nThis isn't...\nthe reaction I was hoping for.\nNot at all.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat was the reaction that you were hoping for?\n\n**Patient:**\nI...\nI had two scenarios in my head.\nIn the first one, you stand up and you hug me...\nand you say, \"I love you.\n\"Love you too, Laura.\n\"I've been feeling this way for a long time, \"I just wanted you to be the first one to say it.\" And then we make love.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd the, erm...\nthe second scenario?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's like the first one but...\nbut without the sex, we just sit here together.\nYou know, I'm embarrassed to even talk about it.\nYou're sitting there like a fucking Buddha, acting like you have no idea what I'm talking about. It's humiliating.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow long have you felt like this?\n\n**Patient:**\nA year.\nFrom the first session.\nI thought it'd go away, I thought, \"It's just an infatuation, that's all.\" But it's getting worse.\nYou've become the centre of my life.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLaura...\nI'm your therapist.\nThe parameters and the limitations...\nare established and ethically defined.\nI'm not an option.\nYou may be using me as a...\nas an excuse to bail from your relationship with, with Andrew.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou know why I didn't fuck that guy?\nNot because of Andrew, not because I didn't wanna cheat on him, I do wanna cheat on him, but with you.\nWhen I was sitting there at the bar by myself, I was thinking, \"What would happen if you were to walk in?\" You'd walk in, you'd sit next to me at the bar, you'd order a drink.\nI even tried to imagine what you would order.\nA shot of bourbon, maybe, something expensive, something fancy.\nThen we'd start talking.\n\"What a coincidence it is to meet like this, \"how awkward it is to meet outside the office.\" And then, without words, because we talk enough when we're here...\nyou motion for me to follow you to the bathroom.\nAnd I do.\nWhen I went into the stall with that guy...\nI imagined it was you behind me.\nThat's what made it so exciting.\nThen that guy started peeing and it woke me up and I realised that it's impossible.\nI know it, I understand it. I tell myself that every time I walk out of here.\nI know it, I understand it but I'm not sure that my body understands it.\nI know it can never happen, I know.\nSo don't worry, I'm not gonna start showing up here, I'm not gonna start stalking you like...\nGlenn Close in that movie.\nI'm not gonna boil your kid's rabbit.\nI'm not dangerous.\nAt least not to you.\nGod, how can I go back to my life?\nTo the hospital, to Andrew.\nNot to Andrew when the only thing that matters to me is you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n Our time's up.\n\n**Patient:**\nYes, it is.\nI feel like I came here in the dark and I'm leaving into a bigger darkness.\nWhat am I gonna do now?\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

Your wife too.\nBut you wouldn't come, would you? Of course you wouldn't.\nBut we did actually talk about it yesterday, right after I said yes, we started making a guest list and for a few minutes you were on it.\nWait a minute, you said yes just yesterday?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYeah.\nI couldn't make up my mind.\nIt took me a few days to get over the other night and our session.\nI, uh... I wanted to calm down first.\n\n**Patient:**\nAndrew was cool, he said a day here or there wouldn't matter as long as I was moving towards a decision.\nYou know, he's very happy that you're helping me.\nFor a while there, he thought he'd made a mistake recommending that I come see you.\nHe thinks you're an amazing therapist and that his instincts were just right, and that you're on our side.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat?\nUh... I guess I'm just trying to get used to...\nto the change in tone.\nYou're speaking in the plural.\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, I'm gonna be a \"we\", an \"us\", aren't I?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou say that like you're not so sure.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, I'm sure.\nYou know, Doctor, I'm generally open to your interpretations, but it just seems like you're being a bit of a...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nKilljoy?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, something like that. So don't.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nJoy is a very rare thing when it comes to me.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'm...\nI'm just wondering if you came here today determined to, uh...\ndemonstrate that joy, especially after last week's events.\nI'm asking myself if this isn't a bit too fast, if you haven't perhaps taken a short cut.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou think that I'm faking this? That I'm actually totally depressed?\nWell, maybe it's you that's faking it, huh?\nI mean, that congratulations was a bit laboured, don't you think?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI...\nI don't know if you know anything about, um, scuba diving.\nThey have this thing that's called the bends.\nIt's something that happens when the divers come up to the surface too quickly.\nIt's really dangerous.\nIt can explode your lungs from the sudden changes in pressure.\nAnyway, it...\nit seems like there's... there's a huge gap between...\nthe depths that you reached last week and the heights...\nat which you are today. I'm just trying to...\nI'm just trying to adjust myself so that I don't, uh...\nI guess, come to the surface too quickly.\n\n**Patient:**\nDo you dive, Doctor?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nI... Well, w-we used to.\n\n**Patient:**\nOoh, who's speaking in the plural now?\nI can't imagine you diving.\nWhere'd you go? Mexico? The Caribbean?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAre you interested in...\nscuba diving?\n\n**Patient:**\nI'm a certified diver.\nI know what the bends are.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSorry.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, seriously, I dove a lot before I met Andrew.\nHe hates it and he's claustrophobic.\nIt's nice to find we have something in common, you and me, isn't it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhere are you now, Laura?\n\n**Patient:**\nI just had a scary thought. I just, um...\nI know it's silly but...\nbeforehand when you said your...\nyour lungs could explode, it was just the thought that something might happen to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYet you're the one who ascended so fast.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou know what, Doctor? I don't want a depressing session.\nI want a happy session. I came with good news, so show a little support.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOK.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK, yesterday, um, I was at Natalie's, you know, Andrew's ex, and Gary, the husband. The ones who had a baby a few months ago.\nThey keep inviting us over and I keep avoiding them but yesterday they invited us for brunch...\nAnyway, Gary makes dim sum. He has those bamboo steamers and everything.\nSo I said to Andrew, \"OK, let's go.\" He's been so sweet all week, I thought it was the least I could do.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo his agreeing to postpone the ultimatum, that...\ndisarmed you?\nAll right. Go ahead.\n\n**Patient:**\nThey have a baby. These huge eyes.\nThe baby is all eyes, so beautiful.\nAnd the way he breast-feeds, all morning he was attached to Natalie's nipple, this huge dark nipple - I've never seen anything like it.\nAt one point she took her boob out of the baby's mouth and squeezed it and some milk squirted out.\nAnd Andrew has this admiring smile on his face, you know, like he was looking at some masterpiece in a museum, like the Madonna.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you think he saw?\nMaybe an image of you and he together in the future, maybe?\n\n**Patient:**\nOr maybe he just misses her tits.\nNo, not really. They're not that nice.\nShe's changed since she had the baby.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIn what way?\n\n**Patient:**\nI didn't really know her before but Andrew told me a lot about her.\nHe said she was this wild type, you know, who had a lot of guys chasing her.\nShe put him through hell. He said they'd go to bed and she'd be one person, they'd wake up and she'd be someone totally new.\nA free radical, that's what he used to call her.\nHe says I remind him of her.\nThat's scary. Like this is what's left of her, her T-shirt's soaking wet and nipples - nipples, that's all that's left.\nShe's like a wild animal that's somehow been...\nShit, what's the word?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDomesticated?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, she looked domesticated, house-broken.\nShe said her wildest sexual fantasy was to sleep four hours straight.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoes that scare you a little?\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, my God.\nI'd die if I turned into a lousy lay, someone who gets fucked in her sleep.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you think that's what happens when people get married?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Does it?\nIs sex something you forget how to do? Or is it like riding a bike?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI think that depends on the...\non the couple.\nOf course, sex, uh...\ncan be...\na subterfuge, it can...\n\n**Patient:**\nDoctor.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOK.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK...\nSo anyway, I go to the kitchen to help out with something and when I come back Andrew and Gary are engrossed in this deep conversation about - you won't believe this - upholsterers.\nThere's this upholsterer who redid their living room and Andrew's taking the guy's number. I'm like, \"What are you doing?\" He said, \"You and I discussed recovering those armchairs your dad gave you.\" I'm telling you, we never discussed this and all of a sudden Andrew's reupholstering armchairs?\nI mean, we're talking metrosexual.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt doesn't sound like the Andrew you've been talking about.\n\n**Patient:**\nExactly! I mean, this was beyond metrosexual.\nDo you ever watch, uh, the Animal Planet?\nYeah, well, it was about this type of bird. I can't remember the name of it, but anyway, the male bird builds a nest for the female.\nYou know, these amazingly intricate structures.\nThey're incredible.\nAnyway, the female goes from nest to nest, you know, checking out all her various mating options, trying to make up her mind, while the male bird is desperately flapping about, trying to attract the female with his architecture.\nYou know, the nests look like cages.\nAnyway...\nthe whole way home I thought I wouldn't be able to fight this any more.\nSo when we got near the house, we were about to park and Andrew said to me, \"Do you want to go to the movies or stay home?\" I said...\nI said yes.\nAnd he says, \"Yes, the movies?\" And I said, \"Yes, home. I'll marry you.\n\"Yes.\" I mean, fuck it.\n\"Fuck, I'll marry you, yes.\" Mm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo where do you think this, um...\n\"Fuck it, yes,\" came from?\nI mean, everything that you've been saying to Andrew, everything you've been doing for the past few weeks has been one big no.\n\n**Patient:**\nI mean, what, you think Andrew took me there as some sort of object lesson?\nTo show me how good it could be for us? Cos I don't think so.\nAndrew's a pretty mediocre psychologist.\nWould you listen to me? I'm already bad-mouthing my future husband.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou didn't answer my question, Laura.\nWhere did this yes come from?\n\n**Patient:**\nYou really don't understand why I said yes to him?\nIt was because you said no to me.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause... Because I said no to you?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe whole situation is just one big fucking no.\nI'm not blaming you or accusing you, I'm just...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDid you expect a different reaction?\nIn your...\nfantasy...\nhow would I respond to you saying that you are, let's say, \"in love with me\"?\n\n**Patient:**\nFirst of all, take the quotation marks off the \"in love with me\".\nIt's insulting.\nAnd stop with the fantasy talk because fantasies are for silly little girls.\nWe're talking about reality, which is that I'm in love with you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBut I still...\n\n**Patient:**\nThat's reality.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI still want to talk about fantasies, for a minute.\nNot the fantasy of a silly little girl, but the fantasy of a grown, smart woman.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, please, let's not do that. That's beneath my dignity.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI don't think there's anything beneath our dignity if it takes us someplace our dignity refuses to go.\nYou remember that story you told me about that summer when you were 15 years old in San Diego?\nThat couple you lived with, the ones who had no children, David and Celia?\nYou said that summer was... was very significant to you.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, my God.\nMy mother just died, Doctor. Of course it was significant. Why rehash all this?\nMy mother died and I was very lucky to have somebody taking me in.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo?\nI want to go back to that period for a bit if you don't mind.\nYour mother was gone, your mother was your last wall of protection against your father... from your father's... How did you put it?\nUh...\n\n**Patient:**\nToxic fumes.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nToxic fumes, yes.\nHis Ioneliness, his fears, his dependency on you.\nYou said he'd call you in California and say how unhappy he was, how much he missed your mother and...\nbegging you to cut your vacation short and come home.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat's this got to do with anything?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou took a liking to these people who were athletic and healthy, the exact opposite of your parents in every way.\nAnd you described David very vividly.\nAnd you said he was very kind to you.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, you know, he used to take me camping, we'd go surfing.\nUsed to just talk about stuff, you know.\nTeenage bullshit.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou...\nYou were very attracted to him?\n\n**Patient:**\nHe was a hunk, yeah.\nHe looked like Nick Nolte.\nThey smoked a lot of grass, a lot of grass.\nI smoked with them. It was my first time.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd...\nwhen that summer was over...\nthey said it was a shame they couldn't adopt you.\n\n**Patient:**\nThey said, \"We want a daughter just like you.\" Yeah, I actually asked them to see if it was possible, if there was some legal way to...\nAnyway, they laughed at me, didn't take me seriously.\nThey said I was \"so cute\".\nActually, I wanted him to adopt me.\nShe was great, Celia, but, you know, I was 15.\nI wanted him all to myself.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMm.\nMakes a lot of sense when you think about it.\nYou were 15 years old, your father was grieving, completely dependent on you.\nDavid must've seemed like a life raft.\nJust as perhaps I am now.\nFrom Andrew.\nPerhaps I'm an alternative to everything Andrew represents - dependency, anxiety.\nBut I am not a realistic option for you, Laura.\nThis is a safe place where you can come.\nLike David with the beach.\n\n**Patient:**\nYes, but with one big difference.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat's that?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't want you to adopt me, I want you to fuck me.\nI need to pee.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUh, there's, um... there's... there's a problem with the, um...\nwith the thing, it's...\nIt's blocked up.\nI'm gonna call the handyman.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK, well, then, may I?\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

It's an Islamic religious school.\nBoys like bees in a beehive studying the Koran.\n16 of them... dead.\nRings a bell?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes, I remember that, yes.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo, that's me.\nI flew that mission.\nThe Madrasah Murderer.\nSo, uh, do you surf the net?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, somehow... Well, it wasn't really somehow, it was...\n\n**Patient:**\nLet's call a spade a spade. A leak. Probably another intelligence fuck-up.\nAnyway, I was identified as the pilot in that mission and my photo was placed on fundamentalist websites.\nAnd I'm not talking Al Jazeera, I'm talking websites that are...\nasking for my head on a platter.\nOffering up the heavens and 40 virgins to anyone who will slit my throat from ear to ear.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHere, um...\n\n**Patient:**\nHere you are. It's not a recent photo. It's a photo taken when I was 18.\nOn a high-school trip to Europe, Holland.\nThat city with the miniatures. Ult... Utrecht.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUtrecht.\n\n**Patient:**\nRight.\nSo while I'm talking to you, a million fanatics are downloading my portrait and printing it out as a dartboard.\nSilly motherfuckers.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo, why have you come to see me?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhoa, whoa. We'll get to that.\nSo you're probably thinking, \"What's it like?\n\"He flew his mission, then he flew back \"and he saw the bodies of those children on CNN.\" You're probably trying to figure out what went through his head.\nLet me tell you, after that kind of mission, I don't watch CNN.\nI go to sleep.\nI'm dead tired.\nAnd you're probably dying to ask how I can sleep nights.\nOK, um...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow do you sleep?\n\n**Patient:**\nI sleep well, thank you very much, knowing it was mission accomplished and with great precision.\nI followed my orders, which were hit my target and hit it on time.\nTime and target. Do you know, we have to hit our targets within two seconds of the estimated time?\nIt's surgical. And that's one small window and I have never missed it.\nIf I had failed that task, I'd be in trouble with my superiors, with my conscience and with the system.\nBut I hit my target.\nSo, I sleep like a baby.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUm, h-how many...\nchildren...\ndied in this... in this mission?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe media puts it at 16.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd the air force?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe navy, Doctor, listen.\nThe navy says nothing and why should it?\nWe're not into body counts, we just hit targets.\nWe don't look back over our shoulder.\nWe do our thing so you can sit here in peace, talking to people for a living.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n So when did you hear that children had been killed?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe following afternoon. I heard it on the internet.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat exactly did you hear?\nAnything specifically that you remember?\n\n**Patient:**\nLike what? It's not like there's time in the day to be surfing the net, this was a moment, I got away.\nThere's a lot of stuff to keep me busy.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat kind of stuff?\n\n**Patient:**\nMission review, aerial photos, videos. Just data, stuff.\nPreparation versus execution.\nEvery tiny technical aspect of our flight is recorded and analysed by the man.\nThere's nowhere to hide. And that's the way it should be.\nIt's just stuff and more stuff.\nWhen my mother died, my father had a year's worth of stuff to deal with.\nLast will and testament, her office, garden, a lifetime of photo albums.\nAnd every time I talked to him, I'd ask how he was, expecting, uh...\nyou know, that... he'd break down.\nFinally.\n\"It never ends, Alex, it never ends. Your mother left such a mess.\n\"She didn't know she was gonna die.\" And that's all he said.\nAfter less than a year, he met another woman and got married, just like that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow did that make you feel?\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, surprised. A whole life together and not a single tear.\nMm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's interesting that you compare the death of your mother with this mission that you've just flown.\n\n**Patient:**\nThat's very clever of you.\nBut there's no relation whatsoever.\nMy mother's death was the most traumatic event in my life so far.\nThat mission was just another mission for Alex. There is no comparison.\nAnyway, look, that's over and I'm back now at my home base and now I'm on R&R.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat kind of things do you do for R&R?\n\n**Patient:**\nDon't try to get ahead of me.\nI'm a runner. I was a hell of a runner in high school and I'm still a good one for an old man. So, I run with my fairy friend.\nThis gay guy who could kick your ass at any sport.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd does he have a name, this friend?\n\n**Patient:**\nMm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDaniel.\n\n**Patient:**\nDaniel.\nWe've been running together for a long time, between six and ten miles.\nDepending on whether one of us is on his period. Only this time, I challenged him.\nIt was no good running in the Middle East, not for the US military, unless you want a bomb to blow your balls off!\nSo, I wanted to do some serious running. I said, \"Let's go for 15.\" After 15 miles, I said, \"20.\" He didn't want it.\nI said, \"OK, I'll go on my own.\" So, he followed.\nI said, \"You know, only six more and it's a marathon. Let's do it.\" He wanted to stop. Little bitch.\nBut I wasn't gonna stop.\nNo stop.\nWe were out of water, we were on fumes.\nAt 22 miles, I had a heart attack and died.\nA textbook case, straight out of med school.\nEnlargement of the left ventricle, in accordance with the family history on both sides, fatal.\nAccording to the EKG and according to statistics, I had a 97.3 per cent chance of dying.\nOr a 2.7 per cent chance of living. Anyway, dead.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou actually died?\n\n**Patient:**\nIn the clinical sense no pulse, no brain activity, total clinical death.\nBut here I am.\nNow I'm gonna disappoint you, Doctor.\nWanna know why I'm gonna disappoint you?\nLet me help you - the light, the tunnel, life flashing before my eyes.\nThat's what you're interested in, right?\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

Come on in.\n\n**Patient:**\nHere?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nDo you need any help with the...\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. It's OK.\nAnna Colden recommended that I talk to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnna Colden?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe's my lawyer. She heard about you from a friend of yours.\nI mean, a friend of hers, not a friend of yours.\nFrom a patient of yours who is a friend of hers. Sorry.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMm. So, Anna Colden recommended you through a patient.\n\n**Patient:**\nDo you know his name?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI don't know.\nSo what did Anna recommend me for?\n\n**Patient:**\nAfter my accident... I told you on the phone about the accident?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\n\n**Patient:**\nThey told me I need the opinion of a psychiatrist because the insurance company of the car that hit me has a problem with my injuries or...\nsomething like that. So that's why I'm here.\nI'm here for your professional opinion, not for...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNot for... Not for therapy?\nSo, let's see if I'm, uh... if I'm getting this right.\nAre you suing the insurance company of the person who hit you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Their insurance company had me talk to a social worker.\nAnd... she started asking me all sorts of annoying questions.\nShe was really annoying so I refused to talk to her.\nShe started talking to me like she knew me, so I refused to talk and that didn't go over so well, so my mother said it would be better if I came to talk to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nRight. So what happened at the accident that requires a psychiatric opinion?\n\n**Patient:**\nI really don't remember what happened.\nI was on my bicycle and a car ran into me and I don't remember what happened next.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat did they tell you afterwards?\n\n**Patient:**\nThat I flew my bike right into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're... You're laughing at that.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat that sounds like, flying straight into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you find that funny, yeah?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause it reminds me of something about two years ago.\nA... A friend of mine, he took me out on this motorbike and he stopped to get something at a convenience store.\nAnyway, I was really bored so I pretended that I knew how to drive it.\nYou put your hands on the handlebars and go like this.\nWell, it was one of those monster bikes.\nJust by turning the handle a little, it just flies.\nSo, suddenly, I'm like, zoom, and it takes off.\nMy head, it whips back like this and when I look down, I realise I'm riding into the street.\nTotally crashed into a car.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nThere was this old woman standing nearby and she saw all this. \"I saw her. She did it on purpose.\n\"She tried to kill herself. She tried to kill herself.\" That's what she was yelling?\nYeah, she was like a crazy woman.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\nCourse, it couldn't have been that funny when it happened, I'm sure?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Not really.\nI wanted to kill her. I was just lying there.\nI couldn't move. I couldn't do anything.\nI wanted to yell, \"Shut up, you... you idiot.\n\"Why are you screaming?\" You know? But I couldn't speak.\nIt's like this feeling...\nwhen somebody says something about you and you can't defend yourself.\nIt's totally unfair.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLike that social worker you were talking about.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat does she have to do with it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, didn't you feel that she was speaking for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, but I could have said something.\nI just didn't want to.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHm.\nSo, tell me a little more about this, uh, this accident.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's all in that report.\n\nWhere did it happen?\n\n**Patient:**\nIn a gas station on Madison near the gym where I train.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you were on the way to the gym?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. I told you I don't remember anything.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you feel comfortable talking about yourself, Sophie?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nMy name is Sophie. I'm 16 years old.\nI've been a gymnast since the age of six and a half.\nI was US junior champion at the age of 12.\nI'm an only child.\nI don't know. What do you wanna know?\nIn another few months are the national trials.\nLast chance to qualify for the Olympics.\nI'm kind of like... an Olympic hopeful.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWow.\nThat's really impressive. Congratulations.\n\n**Patient:**\nThank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo how is life in general?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, apart from the gymnastics.\nHow's life?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's great.\nI just don't have the energy for This Is Your Life right now.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThis Is Your Life? What do... What do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nYou know, like the TV show.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're way too young to know about that show.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's on DVD. My mom's friend watches it all the time.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you think of it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's OK.\nSome of the people on it are so old.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n Why do you think they put old people on that?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Cos they have nothing better to do?\nThey're retired and dying off fast so they put them on the show before it's too late.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo do you think you can help me with this professional opinion or not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's not that simple, Sophie.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause it's not like an X-ray where you can take photographs, look at the results and then you go on your way.\nIt doesn't quite work like that.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nOK, so I guess I'll leave.\nWould you at least like to read what it says in the report?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIf you want me to.\n\n**Patient:**\nLike you already know what it says?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. I've no idea what it says.\n\n**Patient:**\nListen, I didn't come here to talk about myself.\nI just need your opinion.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you want me to give you my opinion based on what I read and the conversation that we've had today, is that it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIs that a problem?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. No.\nI'll write up an opinion and, um...\nwhen you come next week, you can decide whether you want to use it or not.\n\n**Patient:**\nJust like that, without any more questions?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, what kind of questions do you want me to ask?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Shrink-like questions.\nSay, about Mom, Dad, that kind of thing?\nDoesn't sound like you're interested.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy would you say that, Sophie?\nI am very interested in everything that you have to say.\nI mean that.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou spoke to my mother already, didn't you?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI didn't.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou already know what it says in there.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI've never spoken to her.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou did and you're letting me sit here and you know exactly what's in that envelope.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWas I... Was I supposed to talk to her?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat, did you, like, plan everything?\nLike I'm some kind of idiot, you planned some charade?\nWhat's the point? Whatever. She would send me to someone like you.\nI should have listened to my father. He called them a cult of crazies.\nOpen the door for me, please.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd if I did speak to your mom?\n\n**Patient:**\nI knew it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, then?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt means you're a liar, OK?\nCos I know how it's supposed to work.\nYou're supposed to read that report and ask the stupid shrink questions you ask.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoesn't it seems unprofessional to so not do it that way?\nMaybe I have something to say about what it says in there.\nI just wanted to read the report by myself before our meeting next week. That's all.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat meeting next week?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'd like us to meet three or four times for me to form an opinion of you, to get to know you a little.\nDon't you think?\nOtherwise... it wouldn't be professional.\nHm?\nI'll read it now.\nOK?\nSo are all these ships instead of sailing for real?\n\n**Patient:**\nUh-huh.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAt least you won't get seasick.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh...\nI don't know about that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nSometimes I can get quite wobbly just sitting right here.\nYou have to make a round window to the outside.\nThen you'll feel like you're in a real ship.\nDid you really read all those books or is it just to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUh-huh.\n\n**Patient:**\nYes, you read them or yes, you're trying to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nI've read them.\nI feel sorry for the books up there.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh. Why do you feel sorry for them?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhere would you put them?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. They're your fucking books.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou suffer from asthma.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. How do you know that?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThere's an inhaler here.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, thanks. I've been looking everywhere for that. Thank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, you could have died without it?\nAccording to what it says here...\nit looks like you could have died too.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. That would have solved a lot of problems.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat would it solve?\n\n**Patient:**\nNothing. I didn't mean anything by it.\nCan I talk to you like a normal person?\nDo you drive your daughter crazy with questions like this too?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMuch more crazy, believe me.\nHow d'you know I had a daughter?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause you do.\nYou know my mother.\nYou were on the PTA committee at Arlington elementary.\nI was there before I went off to a private school.\nI was in the same year as your daughter.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, why didn't you tell me that before?\n\n**Patient:**\nHm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou said that the, uh... that the social worker spoke to you like she knew you.\n\n**Patient:**\nShe was such a retard.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDid she ask you if, um... if you think about death a lot?\n\n**Patient:**\nHow did you know that?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAccording to what it says here, she was trying to prove that the accident was your fault.\nIt's a good thing you didn't answer any of her questions.\nBy the way, everybody thinks about death.\nI bet she didn't say that, though.\nDid she ask you if you had any specific thoughts about death?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you?\n\n**Patient:**\nDo I what?\nEveryone... Everyone thinks about death and, uh...\nimagines how it will come to them.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you have any more specific thoughts about it?\nI mean, maybe you have certain thoughts that you'd like to talk about.\n\n**Patient:**\nUnless you're worried about what I...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'm not worried.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nIs this how it's going to be for three appointments?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs this a little difficult for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nCan I have some water?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSure.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHang on a minute.\nSorry about this. It's for my little patients, the elves.\nIt's a bendy one.\nYou need help with that?\nMust be really hard to be, uh... be handicapped like that.\nWhat's the hardest thing about it?\n\n**Patient:**\nEveryone treats me like a baby.\nHm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDid you come here by yourself today?\n\n**Patient:**\nYes. By bus.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYour mom didn't offer to drive you?\nYeah, right. She knew there was no chance I'd say yes.\nBefore, when you got angry, when, uh...\nwhen you thought that she'd called me, I asked myself, \"Why didn't she call?\" It makes sense that she would call me first.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI don't... What do you mean?\nI'm trying to figure out why you got so angry when you thought...\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't get it. She did call?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, no.\n\n**Patient:**\nDid she call or not?

It's gonna be the third weekend in June.\nEverybody gets married in June.\nSo...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you'll be a summer bride.\n\n**Patient:**\nEvidently so.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, congratulations.\n\n**Patient:**\nThank you.\nSo, are you happy for us?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs that important to you?\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, if you're gonna be a guest at our wedding, you'd better be happy for us.\nAndrew and I wanted to invite you. Your wife too.\nBut you wouldn't come, would you? Of course you wouldn't.\nBut we did actually talk about it yesterday, right after I said yes, we started making a guest list and for a few minutes you were on it.\nWait a minute, you said yes just yesterday?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYeah.\nI couldn't make up my mind.\nIt took me a few days to get over the other night and our session.\nI, uh... I wanted to calm down first.\n\n**Patient:**\nAndrew was cool, he said a day here or there wouldn't matter as long as I was moving towards a decision.\nYou know, he's very happy that you're helping me.\nFor a while there, he thought he'd made a mistake recommending that I come see you.\nHe thinks you're an amazing therapist and that his instincts were just right, and that you're on our side.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat?\nUh... I guess I'm just trying to get used to...\nto the change in tone.\nYou're speaking in the plural.\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, I'm gonna be a \"we\", an \"us\", aren't I?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou say that like you're not so sure.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, I'm sure.\nYou know, Doctor, I'm generally open to your interpretations, but it just seems like you're being a bit of a...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nKilljoy?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, something like that. So don't.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nJoy is a very rare thing when it comes to me.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'm...\nI'm just wondering if you came here today determined to, uh...\ndemonstrate that joy, especially after last week's events.\nI'm asking myself if this isn't a bit too fast, if you haven't perhaps taken a short cut.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou think that I'm faking this? That I'm actually totally depressed?\nWell, maybe it's you that's faking it, huh?\nI mean, that congratulations was a bit laboured, don't you think?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI...\nI don't know if you know anything about, um, scuba diving.\nThey have this thing that's called the bends.\nIt's something that happens when the divers come up to the surface too quickly.\nIt's really dangerous.\nIt can explode your lungs from the sudden changes in pressure.\nAnyway, it...\nit seems like there's... there's a huge gap between...\nthe depths that you reached last week and the heights...\nat which you are today. I'm just trying to...\nI'm just trying to adjust myself so that I don't, uh...\nI guess, come to the surface too quickly.\n\n**Patient:**\nDo you dive, Doctor?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nI... Well, w-we used to.\n\n**Patient:**\nOoh, who's speaking in the plural now?\nI can't imagine you diving.\nWhere'd you go? Mexico? The Caribbean?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAre you interested in...\nscuba diving?\n\n**Patient:**\nI'm a certified diver.\nI know what the bends are.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSorry.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, seriously, I dove a lot before I met Andrew.\nHe hates it and he's claustrophobic.\nIt's nice to find we have something in common, you and me, isn't it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhere are you now, Laura?\n\n**Patient:**\nI just had a scary thought. I just, um...\nI know it's silly but...\nbeforehand when you said your...\nyour lungs could explode, it was just the thought that something might happen to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYet you're the one who ascended so fast.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou know what, Doctor? I don't want a depressing session.\nI want a happy session. I came with good news, so show a little support.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOK.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK, yesterday, um, I was at Natalie's, you know, Andrew's ex, and Gary, the husband. The ones who had a baby a few months ago.\nThey keep inviting us over and I keep avoiding them but yesterday they invited us for brunch...\nAnyway, Gary makes dim sum. He has those bamboo steamers and everything.\nSo I said to Andrew, \"OK, let's go.\" He's been so sweet all week, I thought it was the least I could do.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo his agreeing to postpone the ultimatum, that...\ndisarmed you?\nAll right. Go ahead.\n\n**Patient:**\nThey have a baby. These huge eyes.\nThe baby is all eyes, so beautiful.\nAnd the way he breast-feeds, all morning he was attached to Natalie's nipple, this huge dark nipple - I've never seen anything like it.\nAt one point she took her boob out of the baby's mouth and squeezed it and some milk squirted out.\nAnd Andrew has this admiring smile on his face, you know, like he was looking at some masterpiece in a museum, like the Madonna.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you think he saw?\nMaybe an image of you and he together in the future, maybe?\n\n**Patient:**\nOr maybe he just misses her tits.\nNo, not really. They're not that nice.\nShe's changed since she had the baby.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIn what way?\n\n**Patient:**\nI didn't really know her before but Andrew told me a lot about her.\nHe said she was this wild type, you know, who had a lot of guys chasing her.\nShe put him through hell. He said they'd go to bed and she'd be one person, they'd wake up and she'd be someone totally new.\nA free radical, that's what he used to call her.\nHe says I remind him of her.\nThat's scary. Like this is what's left of her, her T-shirt's soaking wet and nipples - nipples, that's all that's left.\nShe's like a wild animal that's somehow been...\nShit, what's the word?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDomesticated?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, she looked domesticated, house-broken.\nShe said her wildest sexual fantasy was to sleep four hours straight.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoes that scare you a little?\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, my God.\nI'd die if I turned into a lousy lay, someone who gets fucked in her sleep.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you think that's what happens when people get married?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Does it?\nIs sex something you forget how to do? Or is it like riding a bike?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI think that depends on the...\non the couple.\nOf course, sex, uh...\ncan be...\na subterfuge, it can...\n\n**Patient:**\nDoctor.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOK.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK...\nSo anyway, I go to the kitchen to help out with something and when I come back Andrew and Gary are engrossed in this deep conversation about - you won't believe this - upholsterers.\nThere's this upholsterer who redid their living room and Andrew's taking the guy's number. I'm like, \"What are you doing?\" He said, \"You and I discussed recovering those armchairs your dad gave you.\" I'm telling you, we never discussed this and all of a sudden Andrew's reupholstering armchairs?\nI mean, we're talking metrosexual.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt doesn't sound like the Andrew you've been talking about.\n\n**Patient:**\nExactly! I mean, this was beyond metrosexual.\nDo you ever watch, uh, the Animal Planet?\nYeah, well, it was about this type of bird. I can't remember the name of it, but anyway, the male bird builds a nest for the female.\nYou know, these amazingly intricate structures.\nThey're incredible.\nAnyway, the female goes from nest to nest, you know, checking out all her various mating options, trying to make up her mind, while the male bird is desperately flapping about, trying to attract the female with his architecture.\nYou know, the nests look like cages.\nAnyway...\nthe whole way home I thought I wouldn't be able to fight this any more.\nSo when we got near the house, we were about to park and Andrew said to me, \"Do you want to go to the movies or stay home?\" I said...\nI said yes.\nAnd he says, \"Yes, the movies?\" And I said, \"Yes, home. I'll marry you.\n\"Yes.\" I mean, fuck it.\n\"Fuck, I'll marry you, yes.\" Mm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo where do you think this, um...\n\"Fuck it, yes,\" came from?\nI mean, everything that you've been saying to Andrew, everything you've been doing for the past few weeks has been one big no.\n\n**Patient:**\nI mean, what, you think Andrew took me there as some sort of object lesson?\nTo show me how good it could be for us? Cos I don't think so.\nAndrew's a pretty mediocre psychologist.\nWould you listen to me? I'm already bad-mouthing my future husband.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou didn't answer my question, Laura.\nWhere did this yes come from?\n\n**Patient:**\nYou really don't understand why I said yes to him?\nIt was because you said no to me.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause... Because I said no to you?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe whole situation is just one big fucking no.\nI'm not blaming you or accusing you, I'm just...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDid you expect a different reaction?\nIn your...\nfantasy...\nhow would I respond to you saying that you are, let's say, \"in love with me\"?\n\n**Patient:**\nFirst of all, take the quotation marks off the \"in love with me\".\nIt's insulting.\nAnd stop with the fantasy talk because fantasies are for silly little girls.\nWe're talking about reality, which is that I'm in love with you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBut I still...\n\n**Patient:**\nThat's reality.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI still want to talk about fantasies, for a minute.\nNot the fantasy of a silly little girl, but the fantasy of a grown, smart woman.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, please, let's not do that. That's beneath my dignity.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI don't think there's anything beneath our dignity if it takes us someplace our dignity refuses to go.\nYou remember that story you told me about that summer when you were 15 years old in San Diego?\nThat couple you lived with, the ones who had no children, David and Celia?\nYou said that summer was... was very significant to you.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, my God.\nMy mother just died, Doctor. Of course it was significant. Why rehash all this?\nMy mother died and I was very lucky to have somebody taking me in.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo?\nI want to go back to that period for a bit if you don't mind.\nYour mother was gone, your mother was your last wall of protection against your father... from your father's... How did you put it?\nUh...\n\n**Patient:**\nToxic fumes.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nToxic fumes, yes.\nHis Ioneliness, his fears, his dependency on you.\nYou said he'd call you in California and say how unhappy he was, how much he missed your mother and...\nbegging you to cut your vacation short and come home.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat's this got to do with anything?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou took a liking to these people who were athletic and healthy, the exact opposite of your parents in every way.\nAnd you described David very vividly.\nAnd you said he was very kind to you.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, you know, he used to take me camping, we'd go surfing.\nUsed to just talk about stuff, you know.\nTeenage bullshit.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou...\nYou were very attracted to him?\n\n**Patient:**\nHe was a hunk, yeah.\nHe looked like Nick Nolte.\nThey smoked a lot of grass, a lot of grass.\nI smoked with them. It was my first time.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd...\nwhen that summer was over...\nthey said it was a shame they couldn't adopt you.\n\n**Patient:**\nThey said, \"We want a daughter just like you.\" Yeah, I actually asked them to see if it was possible, if there was some legal way to...\nAnyway, they laughed at me, didn't take me seriously.\nThey said I was \"so cute\".\nActually, I wanted him to adopt me.\nShe was great, Celia, but, you know, I was 15.\nI wanted him all to myself.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMm.\nMakes a lot of sense when you think about it.\nYou were 15 years old, your father was grieving, completely dependent on you.\nDavid must've seemed like a life raft.\nJust as perhaps I am now.\nFrom Andrew.\nPerhaps I'm an alternative to everything Andrew represents - dependency, anxiety.\nBut I am not a realistic option for you, Laura.\nThis is a safe place where you can come.\nLike David with the beach.\n\n**Patient:**\nYes, but with one big difference.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat's that?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't want you to adopt me, I want you to fuck me.\nI need to pee.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUh, there's, um... there's... there's a problem with the, um...\nwith the thing, it's...\nIt's blocked up.\nI'm gonna call the handyman.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK, well, then, may I?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUh, well...\nWe're almost out of time, so...\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat, are we camping? I need to pee. What's the big deal?\nI won't mess your bathroom.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI prefer my patients to use the...\n\n**Patient:**\nBut you just said that the toilet overflowed.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy don't we just finish up for today?\nI can owe you the ten minutes when you come back next week.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat, you're afraid your wife will see me?\nOr that I'll see her?\nIs she even home now?\nIs she sitting with rollers in her hair drinking beer?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThis is nothing to do with my wife.\n\n**Patient:**\nForget it, if it freaks you out that much.\nWell, I bet that didn't come up in med school, did it?\nHm?\nWhat to do in the following situation.\nA patient, in love with her therapist, asks to use the bathroom.\nThe bathroom is out of order.\nThe patient then asks to enter the therapist's home.\nWhat should the therapist do?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'm sorry if...\n\n**Patient:**\nThe correct answer is it depends on what the therapist feels towards his patient.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI can see that you might interpret...\n\n**Patient:**\nDon't interpret, Doctor.\nI've had it up to here with your fucking interpretations.\nYou know what kills me? That no matter what I say or do, you see everything as more proof that nothing is going on here.\nYou turn me into a 15-year-old who isn't taken seriously.\nA silly girl who people pat on the head and say, \"Isn't she cute?\"\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou know, the... I...\n\n**Patient:**\nStop patronising me, Doctor.\nLook, I know when I turn somebody on, OK?\nYou know what I thought of you the first time I saw you?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat?\n\n**Patient:**\nI thought you looked like a dead man.\nI thought beneath that professional exterior is a man who's stopped living.\nI wanted to take your heart in my hands and...\njust pump life into it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMaybe that's your sense of, um...\nof what happens to married people, that they just stop living.\nMaybe you're afraid that's what'll happen if you marry Andrew.\n\n**Patient:**\nJust my being here has brought you back to life.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLaura, let's, um...\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. I knew you'd deny it.\nI mean, how can something like this happen to you?\nBut I know it happened and you know it happened.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat happened?\n\n**Patient:**\nMe and you, Doctor. We happened.\nAnd all the thoughts that you have before you fall asleep next to your wife happened.\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

My car's at home.\nGod, at least I think it is.\nYeah, yeah, my car's at home.\nGod, it's freezing. I came this close to knocking on your door and asking for a sweater.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhen was that?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know, maybe five or six.\nI can't remember. It was still dark.\nWaited for the sun to come up.\nI never waited this long for a sunrise, except maybe on a camping trip in fifth grade.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThank you.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou know what I did?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat?\n\n**Patient:**\nI held my cellphone and I watched the minutes go by.\nIt felt like forever for one minute to turn into the next.\nI thought to myself, \"How stupid is this?\n\"Dying on a street like roadkill outside your therapist's office.\" I'm sorry, Doctor, I...\nI should have called it off. I shouldn't have come.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou should have come here.\nWhat happened last night?\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, what didn't happen?\nWant the long version or the bottom line?\nBecause the bottom line's very simple.\nMy life is over.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThen you'd better tell me the long version.\n\n**Patient:**\nI left Andrew. We had a big blowout screaming, crying, the works.\nThen at some point, I called Ilona, and we went out for a drink, and...\nwe had a few drinks.\nListen, I'm not here. I'm so totally not here.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou are very much here, Laura.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, it's not me that's here.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBelieve me, you'd be shocked to know the person that's sitting here.\n\n**Patient:**\nDid some...\nI did some terrible things last night.\n I feel sick.\nI don't wanna throw up.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoesn't matter, it's no big deal.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat do you mean?\nIt's vomit. I'm not gonna vomit all over your rug.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's a cheap rug, Laura.\nLet's talk about what's really going on here.\nHm?\n\n**Patient:**\n  It's Andrew. He knows I'm here at this time. Why is he calling me here?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMaybe he's worried. You were out all night.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, right. If he really cared, he wouldn't have started with this shit.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nStart what?\n\n**Patient:**\nAt the club with this guy...\nOh, my God.\nHe had corduroy pants on, preppy sweater.\nRepublican probably.\n  Can I just step out for a second and let him know I'm here?\nI can't concentrate with this shit.\nJust a sec.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLaura, the call can wait.\n\n**Patient:**\n Andrew gave me an ultimatum.\nEither we get married or we split.\nSaid he wants an answer in a day or two at the most, or else he's out.\nSaid he can't take it any more.\nThat he loves me, that he doesn't believe I love him, not for real.\nThat it's been two years already, on and off, blah, blah, blah.\nI don't know why. All of a sudden, he just started ranting and raving.\nWe've talked about this stuff before, but it was all in theory if we stayed together, if.\nAnd suddenly out of the blue, I can't even remember what we were doing...\nWe were watching TV.\nAll of a sudden he just gets off the couch, grabs the remote and turns off the TV, and he turns to me and he has tears in his eyes and he says, \"That's it, I can't take it any more.\" So out of line. He promised he'd lay off the subject for a while.\nAnd all of a sudden he's on this crying bullshit.\nHe actually burst out crying. I've never seen him like that before.\nAnd to tell you the truth it really scared me.\nNo, it made me angry.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy?\n\n**Patient:**\nHe's trying to manipulate me with these cheap chick tricks.\nMaybe he thought he would break my heart or something.\nOr appeal to my...\nShit, you know, forget it, I don't know.\nI threw a tantrum like a three-year-old.\nI screamed, cried...\ntold him to fuck off...\ntold him he was a little piece of shit for doing this to me when he knows I'm working double shifts at the hospital this week.\nI slammed the door, smashed his laptop on the floor, I killed it, I ran out and I called Ilona.\nShe dressed me in this outfit.\nIt's, it's not mine.\nWe went out for a drink at a club that she likes on Chester Street.\nShe tried to calm me down, put things into perspective.\nAnd she said...\nShe said that I was lucky...\nthat she wished somebody had loved her enough to give her an ultimatum.\nAnd then we drank. Well, I drank.\nAnd there's this guy at the bar, and at some point Ilona said that she was tired and that she needed to go home.\nAnd then that guy...\nmoved next to me, and, erm...\nYou know what he said?\nHe said, \"You look so sad.\" And I said, \"Really?\" And he said, \"Yeah, you do. It looks good on you.\" \"Looks good on you.\" Whatever happened to, \"Do you have the time?\" or, \"Haven't we met before?\" I must be totally out of touch, Doctor.\nWhat do you think? I mean, do I look good when I'm sad?\nI don't think anybody looks good when they're sad.\nAnd then, er, I don't know how much I had to drink cos he was ordering for me, of course, and then he paid the bill and he asked me, \"Would you like to go somewhere else?\" And I said, \"Yes, I'd like to go to the bathroom.\" So I stood up and I went to the bathroom, he follows me.\nAnd you wouldn't believe it but these were unisex bathrooms.\nAm I unlucky or what?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow do you mean, unlucky?\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, I'm running away from a guy and I'm...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou were trying to get away from the guy.\n\n**Patient:**\nI mean, I needed to pee, by myself, I've been doing that since I was three.\nSo I realise I needed to make a decision.\nBy following me to the bathroom, this guy was also giving me an ultimatum.\nI thought, \"Fuck, out of the pan and into the fire.\" I ran away from one ultimatum, and there was this guy with a hard on giving me another.\nSuddenly I felt like doing it.\nI never had sex in a bathroom before.\nI mean, what, I should go and marry Andrew without ever knowing what a good bathroom fuck's all about?\nIt's part of a young lady's education, isn't it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you wanted to do it but not to get back at Andrew, just for yourself?\n\n**Patient:**\nThat's right.\nA girl being forced into marriage...\nwhat's she supposed to do, die ignorant?\nSo this guy follows me into the stall and...\nsuddenly...\nI was horny.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs hearing about this disgusting to you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. It's not disgusting.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nGo on.\n\n**Patient:**\nHe unzipped, pulled down his pants, and he stood there with this...\nhuge...\nOh, God, I felt like I was 16...\ntouching it for the very first time.\nI was really surprised at how...\nwarm it felt.\nI mean, don't I know that already?\nAnd then he turned me round to face the door...\nand he pulled down my stockings.\nHe lifted up my skirt, put his hand into his back pocket and pulled out a condom.\nI realise this guy's very good at this, he does this a lot, he's a real pro.\nAnd then this guy entered the stall next to us and started peeing, and gushes full volume like a racehorse.\nAnd I thought of Andrew...\nhow... how he pees in the morning, making the same sound.\nMy heart ached, I just...\nIt was so stupid, you know, I just felt so sad all of a sudden, and then he's behind me and he's rubbing up against me and he's feeling me up.\nAnd I thought to myself, \"It's gonna happen any moment now,\" and I just...\nI just couldn't do it.\nI simply closed my legs shut. I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it to Andrew.\nI just couldn't do it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, seems like quite a night out.\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, yeah, that's not the end of it, because this idiot, I told him, \"I'm really sorry but I have a boyfriend, I can't do this.\" And he says, \"Boo-hoo,\" and he grabs my hands and he says, \"Listen, cupcake, you think you can leave me high and dry like this?\" Pointing at his dick.\n\"The least you can do is make it up to me.\" I said to him, \"What do you want? You want some money?\" He said, \"Give me a hand job \"and there'll be no hard feelings.\" And I said to him, \"What's the matter with you? Are you crazy?\" And it was just getting really strange. It was tense. His tone changed.\nAnd then...\nAnd then I thought of you.\nWhat you'd say about it.\nI thought about us going through this in therapy.\nAnd what did you imagine us saying?\nI imagined you not being able to understand it.\nThat you'd be disgusted.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs that why you ran over here?\nTo find out if I would be disgusted?\n\n**Patient:**\nI didn't run.\nI gave him the hand job.\nGod. Excuse me.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n You OK?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. Yeah, I'm fine.\n Yeah.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThank you.\n\n**Patient:**\nWe, erm...\nWe talked about what happened at the, er, the club last night but we never got back to actually talking about Andrew and that argument yesterday.\nI don't wanna be put in this position.\nI don't wanna have this power to decide our future for both of us. I just don't.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you have any idea why Andrew chose this particular time?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat do you mean?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you think that Andrew, just out of the blue, as you said yourself, came up with this idea of an ultimatum?\nDid you notice anything over the last couple of days or weeks that you think might have brought this on?\n\n**Patient:**\nNothing, I don't know. He just lost it.\nShit, don't you know that men are the new women?\nObsessed with weddings and children. And lately he's lost touch with reality.\nHe thinks I'm seeing someone. That's how this whole thing started. It's unbelievable.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI thought you said it came out of nowhere.\nYou were watching TV and then suddenly...\n\n**Patient:**\nWe were watching TV but, before that, we were having dinner and he had this look on his face, this sad look, and I could tell something was up. You can just tell, right?\nAnd I said to him, \"What's going on?\" And he said, \"I don't know what I want, \"I just know I don't want this on-and-off thing.\" So I said to him, \"Sure.\" And then, \"Let's just decide, either we get married or we split.\"\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you were the one who came up with it.\n\n**Patient:**\nWith what?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe ultimatum.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, he's the one.\nHe had the problem with the on-and-off thing.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYeah, but on and off can mean several things.\nYou were the one who made it specific get married or to split up, that was your ultimatum.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, no, no, he had this thing with this on and o...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe ultim...\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, OK. I was the first one to say it, you're right.\nBut he jumped all over it. I said I didn't know what I want and he said, \"You have a day or two max to decide what you want.\" And I said, \"Fine.\" And then he started crying and blah, blah, blah.\nThe whole thing was scary to him, I think.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat about you? Weren't you scared?\n\n**Patient:**\nOf what?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOf splitting up.\n\n**Patient:**\nI wasn't suggesting that we split up. That's not the point.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what do you think was the point of this argument that you may have initiated?\n\n**Patient:**\nI didn't initiate anything.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, you may not have meant to, but you did.\nIt sounds like you wanted to bring this relationship into crisis.\nI know you say that Andrew hates uncertainties but perhaps you're the one who can't live with them.\nWhy did you choose this particular time to bring things to a head?\n\n**Patient:**\nI did no such thing.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy now?\n\n**Patient:**\nCos he's right.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAndrew's right.\n\n**Patient:**\nI am being unfaithful to him.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou mean what happened last night at the club?\n\n**Patient:**\nNot just last night.\nI've been unfaithful to him for a long time.\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

I'm a customer.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYeah.\nThough in my profession, we say that the customer is always wrong.\nIt's a... It's a therapist's joke.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo, do you recognise me?\nNo.\nI'm sorry, uh, should I?\nI was told you were the best, a man in tune with everything around him,\nso you should.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThank you.\nBut I do think that in this profession, \"the best\" is really a matter of personal opinion.\nNo, the best can be established by facts and figures.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou're the best. I did my research.\nCouple of former patients, someone who knew you from graduate school.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoes that pressure you?\nIs it important for you to know\nthat I am the best?\n\n**Patient:**\nYes.\nIt's nothing personal, I always go to the best - dentists, mechanics.\nYou know what they say - save now, pay later.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what do you think being the best therapist entails?\n\n**Patient:**\nDo you recognise me?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, I...\nI... I don't.\n\n**Patient:**\nLet me help.\nThe Madrasah Murderer.\nDoes that mean anything to you?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt wasn't that long ago.\nUS Navy aircraft hit a target on the outskirts of Baghdad.\nNaval Intelligence identified the structure as an insurgents' safe house, a bunker. Turns out it's a madrasah.\nLet me tell you what that is. It's an Islamic religious school.\nBoys like bees in a beehive studying the Koran.\n16 of them... dead.\nRings a bell?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes, I remember that, yes.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo, that's me.\nI flew that mission.\nThe Madrasah Murderer.\nSo, uh, do you surf the net?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, somehow... Well, it wasn't really somehow, it was...\n\n**Patient:**\nLet's call a spade a spade. A leak. Probably another intelligence fuck-up.\nAnyway, I was identified as the pilot in that mission and my photo was placed on fundamentalist websites.\nAnd I'm not talking Al Jazeera, I'm talking websites that are...\nasking for my head on a platter.\nOffering up the heavens and 40 virgins to anyone who will slit my throat from ear to ear.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHere, um...\n\n**Patient:**\nHere you are. It's not a recent photo. It's a photo taken when I was 18.\nOn a high-school trip to Europe, Holland.\nThat city with the miniatures. Ult... Utrecht.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUtrecht.\n\n**Patient:**\nRight.\nSo while I'm talking to you, a million fanatics are downloading my portrait and printing it out as a dartboard.\nSilly motherfuckers.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo, why have you come to see me?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhoa, whoa. We'll get to that.\nSo you're probably thinking, \"What's it like?\n\"He flew his mission, then he flew back \"and he saw the bodies of those children on CNN.\" You're probably trying to figure out what went through his head.\nLet me tell you, after that kind of mission, I don't watch CNN.\nI go to sleep.\nI'm dead tired.\nAnd you're probably dying to ask how I can sleep nights.\nOK, um...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow do you sleep?\n\n**Patient:**\nI sleep well, thank you very much, knowing it was mission accomplished and with great precision.\nI followed my orders, which were hit my target and hit it on time.\nTime and target. Do you know, we have to hit our targets within two seconds of the estimated time?\nIt's surgical. And that's one small window and I have never missed it.\nIf I had failed that task, I'd be in trouble with my superiors, with my conscience and with the system.\nBut I hit my target.\nSo, I sleep like a baby.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUm, h-how many...\nchildren...\ndied in this... in this mission?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe media puts it at 16.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd the air force?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe navy, Doctor, listen.\nThe navy says nothing and why should it?\nWe're not into body counts, we just hit targets.\nWe don't look back over our shoulder.\nWe do our thing so you can sit here in peace, talking to people for a living.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n So when did you hear that children had been killed?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe following afternoon. I heard it on the internet.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat exactly did you hear?\nAnything specifically that you remember?\n\n**Patient:**\nLike what? It's not like there's time in the day to be surfing the net, this was a moment, I got away.\nThere's a lot of stuff to keep me busy.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat kind of stuff?\n\n**Patient:**\nMission review, aerial photos, videos. Just data, stuff.\nPreparation versus execution.\nEvery tiny technical aspect of our flight is recorded and analysed by the man.\nThere's nowhere to hide. And that's the way it should be.\nIt's just stuff and more stuff.\nWhen my mother died, my father had a year's worth of stuff to deal with.\nLast will and testament, her office, garden, a lifetime of photo albums.\nAnd every time I talked to him, I'd ask how he was, expecting, uh...\nyou know, that... he'd break down.\nFinally.\n\"It never ends, Alex, it never ends. Your mother left such a mess.\n\"She didn't know she was gonna die.\" And that's all he said.\nAfter less than a year, he met another woman and got married, just like that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow did that make you feel?\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, surprised. A whole life together and not a single tear.\nMm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's interesting that you compare the death of your mother with this mission that you've just flown.\n\n**Patient:**\nThat's very clever of you.\nBut there's no relation whatsoever.\nMy mother's death was the most traumatic event in my life so far.\nThat mission was just another mission for Alex. There is no comparison.\nAnyway, look, that's over and I'm back now at my home base and now I'm on R&R.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat kind of things do you do for R&R?\n\n**Patient:**\nDon't try to get ahead of me.\nI'm a runner. I was a hell of a runner in high school and I'm still a good one for an old man. So, I run with my fairy friend.\nThis gay guy who could kick your ass at any sport.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd does he have a name, this friend?\n\n**Patient:**\nMm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDaniel.\n\n**Patient:**\nDaniel.\nWe've been running together for a long time, between six and ten miles.\nDepending on whether one of us is on his period. Only this time, I challenged him.\nIt was no good running in the Middle East, not for the US military, unless you want a bomb to blow your balls off!\nSo, I wanted to do some serious running. I said, \"Let's go for 15.\" After 15 miles, I said, \"20.\" He didn't want it.\nI said, \"OK, I'll go on my own.\" So, he followed.\nI said, \"You know, only six more and it's a marathon. Let's do it.\" He wanted to stop. Little bitch.\nBut I wasn't gonna stop.\nNo stop.\nWe were out of water, we were on fumes.\nAt 22 miles, I had a heart attack and died.\nA textbook case, straight out of med school.\nEnlargement of the left ventricle, in accordance with the family history on both sides, fatal.\nAccording to the EKG and according to statistics, I had a 97.3 per cent chance of dying.\nOr a 2.7 per cent chance of living. Anyway, dead.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou actually died?\n\n**Patient:**\nIn the clinical sense no pulse, no brain activity, total clinical death.\nBut here I am.\nNow I'm gonna disappoint you, Doctor.\nWanna know why I'm gonna disappoint you?\nLet me help you - the light, the tunnel, life flashing before my eyes.\nThat's what you're interested in, right?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, I wasn't actually thinking of that at all, but I am interested.\nTell me.\n\n**Patient:**\nI couldn't give a shit about it either.\nBut that's all everyone wanted to know about - my father, my wife.\nEveryone wanted to hear about the goddamn tunnel.\nJust such bullshit.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you feel that maybe you disappointed people by not having that experience?\nThat maybe in some way you failed to deliver the goods?\n\n**Patient:**\nNobody really knows what was going through my mind during those last few moments.\nAs soon as there was no more tunnel, no one was interested.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd what was going through your mind?\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, I knew what was happening, you can tell.\nAnd you're afraid it's the end.\nIn all that time until I lost consciousness...\nAll that time... I don't know, it was maybe seconds, maybe half a minute.\nAll that time I kept trying to figure out if I had a hard-on.\nI don't know how I remembered, it was something my grandmother told me, when I was in high school, and she said when Grandpa died, she found him lying naked in the bathtub with a huge erection.\nNow, he's... he was 92 years old.\nShe hadn't seen an erection like that in 20 years.\nShe liked it. She said that was God's final gift to a man.\nA dead man's boner. They call it angel lust.\nAnyway, I'm lying there thinking about that story.\nI know what's happening and I said to myself, \"God Almighty, just don't let me have an erection now, not a hard-on.\" Because if you had an erection, it would mean...\nThat would mean that I was dead.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd your friend Daniel was with you throughout this?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, resuscitation, CPR... Daniel's a doctor. I forgot to say that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh. For a minute I thought you were going to say something else, that perhaps your fear of an erection was associated with the presence of your friend, Daniel.\n\n**Patient:**\nExcuse me?\nYou're exaggerating. I explained something simple, a dead man's erection - what's that got to do with Daniel?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, maybe I didn't make myself clear earlier on when I was talking about the customer always being wrong.\nWhat I meant was that sometimes the patient hides things from his therapist, from himself.\nAnd so part of our job is to uncover the things that we hide.\n\n**Patient:**\n So, my secret is I'm afraid of homosexuals?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, not necessarily. But I just wanted to clarify that.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, that's neither here nor there. I want to get to my point.\nI didn't have the erection, so relax.\nBut I remember very vividly that moment just before passing out, before losing consciousness.\nLosing consciousness, that's a funny expression.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy do you think that's a funny expression?\n\n**Patient:**\nLosing consciousness - it's an expression my father would use.\nEverything in terms of profits and loss.\nFits him like a glove.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo something about how you describe your last moments is equated with your father's seeing things in terms of profit and loss?\n\n**Patient:**\nOK, OK, with all due respect, I think we've come to this way too early.\nThe father-son relationship stuff shouldn't come up so soon.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou think it's too soon?\n\n**Patient:**\nForget what I feel.\nI know it's too soon. I wanna know what you think.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you're... You're testing me?\n\n**Patient:**\nI'm entitled to some testing. I'm paying.\nActually, I think you've been testing me since you walked in.\nYou've asked about me and my reputation, you ask, you practically demand that I ask certain questions that you think I am dying to ask.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's important to you, I think, that I adhere to certain standards you set before you walked through the door.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat's wrong with that? Look, I did my research.\nIt's a 1  1/2 hour drive to get here and I'm paying you good money.\nAnd I'm expected to tell you, a perfect stranger, the most intimate things about my life.\nPlus there are risks here.\nIt's not like the navy's gonna give me a medal for spilling my guts, I'm not gonna open up to you without knowing what you are.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd what do you expect to find, Alex?\nHow are we going to know that I'm a good enough therapist for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nI'll know...\naccording to your opinion.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMy opinion of what?\n\n**Patient:**\nOf the issue I came to talk about.\nBut I'll come to that in a minute.\nIt's to do with what happened after taking me out of the freezer.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe freezer?\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, you mean that you were grounded?\nNo, literally frozen. They froze me.\nThe mobile intensive care unit arrived and put me in a suit that freezes you.\nThey got one no more than three-quarters of a mile from where I collapsed.\nAnd their ER is tops.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLet's go back to this...\n\n**Patient:**\nWe're getting there. You have no patience.\nI was told you're a good listener.\nNow look, it works on a very simple principle.\nIt reduces the shock to the body's systems by dropping the body temperature.\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

My car's at home.\nGod, at least I think it is.\nYeah, yeah, my car's at home.\nGod, it's freezing. I came this close to knocking on your door and asking for a sweater.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhen was that?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know, maybe five or six.\nI can't remember. It was still dark.\nWaited for the sun to come up.\nI never waited this long for a sunrise, except maybe on a camping trip in fifth grade.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThank you.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou know what I did?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat?\n\n**Patient:**\nI held my cellphone and I watched the minutes go by.\nIt felt like forever for one minute to turn into the next.\nI thought to myself, \"How stupid is this?\n\"Dying on a street like roadkill outside your therapist's office.\" I'm sorry, Doctor, I...\nI should have called it off. I shouldn't have come.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou should have come here.\nWhat happened last night?\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, what didn't happen?\nWant the long version or the bottom line?\nBecause the bottom line's very simple.\nMy life is over.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThen you'd better tell me the long version.\n\n**Patient:**\nI left Andrew. We had a big blowout screaming, crying, the works.\nThen at some point, I called Ilona, and we went out for a drink, and...\nwe had a few drinks.\nListen, I'm not here. I'm so totally not here.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou are very much here, Laura.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, it's not me that's here.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBelieve me, you'd be shocked to know the person that's sitting here.\n\n**Patient:**\nDid some...\nI did some terrible things last night.\n I feel sick.\nI don't wanna throw up.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoesn't matter, it's no big deal.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat do you mean?\nIt's vomit. I'm not gonna vomit all over your rug.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's a cheap rug, Laura.\nLet's talk about what's really going on here.\nHm?\n\n**Patient:**\n  It's Andrew. He knows I'm here at this time. Why is he calling me here?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMaybe he's worried. You were out all night.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, right. If he really cared, he wouldn't have started with this shit.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nStart what?\n\n**Patient:**\nAt the club with this guy...\nOh, my God.\nHe had corduroy pants on, preppy sweater.\nRepublican probably.\n  Can I just step out for a second and let him know I'm here?\nI can't concentrate with this shit.\nJust a sec.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLaura, the call can wait.\n\n**Patient:**\n Andrew gave me an ultimatum.\nEither we get married or we split.\nSaid he wants an answer in a day or two at the most, or else he's out.\nSaid he can't take it any more.\nThat he loves me, that he doesn't believe I love him, not for real.\nThat it's been two years already, on and off, blah, blah, blah.\nI don't know why. All of a sudden, he just started ranting and raving.\nWe've talked about this stuff before, but it was all in theory if we stayed together, if.\nAnd suddenly out of the blue, I can't even remember what we were doing...\nWe were watching TV.\nAll of a sudden he just gets off the couch, grabs the remote and turns off the TV, and he turns to me and he has tears in his eyes and he says, \"That's it, I can't take it any more.\" So out of line. He promised he'd lay off the subject for a while.\nAnd all of a sudden he's on this crying bullshit.\nHe actually burst out crying. I've never seen him like that before.\nAnd to tell you the truth it really scared me.\nNo, it made me angry.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy?\n\n**Patient:**\nHe's trying to manipulate me with these cheap chick tricks.\nMaybe he thought he would break my heart or something.\nOr appeal to my...\nShit, you know, forget it, I don't know.\nI threw a tantrum like a three-year-old.\nI screamed, cried...\ntold him to fuck off...\ntold him he was a little piece of shit for doing this to me when he knows I'm working double shifts at the hospital this week.\nI slammed the door, smashed his laptop on the floor, I killed it, I ran out and I called Ilona.\nShe dressed me in this outfit.\nIt's, it's not mine.\nWe went out for a drink at a club that she likes on Chester Street.\nShe tried to calm me down, put things into perspective.\nAnd she said...\nShe said that I was lucky...\nthat she wished somebody had loved her enough to give her an ultimatum.\nAnd then we drank. Well, I drank.\nAnd there's this guy at the bar, and at some point Ilona said that she was tired and that she needed to go home.\nAnd then that guy...\nmoved next to me, and, erm...\nYou know what he said?\nHe said, \"You look so sad.\" And I said, \"Really?\" And he said, \"Yeah, you do. It looks good on you.\" \"Looks good on you.\" Whatever happened to, \"Do you have the time?\" or, \"Haven't we met before?\" I must be totally out of touch, Doctor.\nWhat do you think? I mean, do I look good when I'm sad?\nI don't think anybody looks good when they're sad.\nAnd then, er, I don't know how much I had to drink cos he was ordering for me, of course, and then he paid the bill and he asked me, \"Would you like to go somewhere else?\" And I said, \"Yes, I'd like to go to the bathroom.\" So I stood up and I went to the bathroom, he follows me.\nAnd you wouldn't believe it but these were unisex bathrooms.\nAm I unlucky or what?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow do you mean, unlucky?\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, I'm running away from a guy and I'm...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou were trying to get away from the guy.\n\n**Patient:**\nI mean, I needed to pee, by myself, I've been doing that since I was three.\nSo I realise I needed to make a decision.\nBy following me to the bathroom, this guy was also giving me an ultimatum.\nI thought, \"Fuck, out of the pan and into the fire.\" I ran away from one ultimatum, and there was this guy with a hard on giving me another.\nSuddenly I felt like doing it.\nI never had sex in a bathroom before.\nI mean, what, I should go and marry Andrew without ever knowing what a good bathroom fuck's all about?\nIt's part of a young lady's education, isn't it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you wanted to do it but not to get back at Andrew, just for yourself?\n\n**Patient:**\nThat's right.\nA girl being forced into marriage...\nwhat's she supposed to do, die ignorant?\nSo this guy follows me into the stall and...\nsuddenly...\nI was horny.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs hearing about this disgusting to you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. It's not disgusting.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nGo on.\n\n**Patient:**\nHe unzipped, pulled down his pants, and he stood there with this...\nhuge...\nOh, God, I felt like I was 16...\ntouching it for the very first time.\nI was really surprised at how...\nwarm it felt.\nI mean, don't I know that already?\nAnd then he turned me round to face the door...\nand he pulled down my stockings.\nHe lifted up my skirt, put his hand into his back pocket and pulled out a condom.\nI realise this guy's very good at this, he does this a lot, he's a real pro.\nAnd then this guy entered the stall next to us and started peeing, and gushes full volume like a racehorse.\nAnd I thought of Andrew...\nhow... how he pees in the morning, making the same sound.\nMy heart ached, I just...\nIt was so stupid, you know, I just felt so sad all of a sudden, and then he's behind me and he's rubbing up against me and he's feeling me up.\nAnd I thought to myself, \"It's gonna happen any moment now,\" and I just...\nI just couldn't do it.\nI simply closed my legs shut. I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it to Andrew.\nI just couldn't do it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, seems like quite a night out.\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, yeah, that's not the end of it, because this idiot, I told him, \"I'm really sorry but I have a boyfriend, I can't do this.\" And he says, \"Boo-hoo,\" and he grabs my hands and he says, \"Listen, cupcake, you think you can leave me high and dry like this?\" Pointing at his dick.\n\"The least you can do is make it up to me.\" I said to him, \"What do you want? You want some money?\" He said, \"Give me a hand job \"and there'll be no hard feelings.\" And I said to him, \"What's the matter with you? Are you crazy?\" And it was just getting really strange. It was tense. His tone changed.\nAnd then...\nAnd then I thought of you.\nWhat you'd say about it.\nI thought about us going through this in therapy.\nAnd what did you imagine us saying?\nI imagined you not being able to understand it.\nThat you'd be disgusted.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs that why you ran over here?\nTo find out if I would be disgusted?\n\n**Patient:**\nI didn't run.\nI gave him the hand job.\nGod. Excuse me.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n You OK?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. Yeah, I'm fine.\n Yeah.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThank you.\n\n**Patient:**\nWe, erm...\nWe talked about what happened at the, er, the club last night but we never got back to actually talking about Andrew and that argument yesterday.\nI don't wanna be put in this position.\nI don't wanna have this power to decide our future for both of us. I just don't.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you have any idea why Andrew chose this particular time?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat do you mean?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you think that Andrew, just out of the blue, as you said yourself, came up with this idea of an ultimatum?\nDid you notice anything over the last couple of days or weeks that you think might have brought this on?\n\n**Patient:**\nNothing, I don't know. He just lost it.\nShit, don't you know that men are the new women?\nObsessed with weddings and children. And lately he's lost touch with reality.\nHe thinks I'm seeing someone. That's how this whole thing started. It's unbelievable.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI thought you said it came out of nowhere.\nYou were watching TV and then suddenly...\n\n**Patient:**\nWe were watching TV but, before that, we were having dinner and he had this look on his face, this sad look, and I could tell something was up. You can just tell, right?\nAnd I said to him, \"What's going on?\" And he said, \"I don't know what I want, \"I just know I don't want this on-and-off thing.\" So I said to him, \"Sure.\" And then, \"Let's just decide, either we get married or we split.\"\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you were the one who came up with it.\n\n**Patient:**\nWith what?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe ultimatum.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, he's the one.\nHe had the problem with the on-and-off thing.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYeah, but on and off can mean several things.\nYou were the one who made it specific get married or to split up, that was your ultimatum.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, no, no, he had this thing with this on and o...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe ultim...\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, OK. I was the first one to say it, you're right.\nBut he jumped all over it. I said I didn't know what I want and he said, \"You have a day or two max to decide what you want.\" And I said, \"Fine.\" And then he started crying and blah, blah, blah.\nThe whole thing was scary to him, I think.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat about you? Weren't you scared?\n\n**Patient:**\nOf what?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOf splitting up.\n\n**Patient:**\nI wasn't suggesting that we split up. That's not the point.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what do you think was the point of this argument that you may have initiated?\n\n**Patient:**\nI didn't initiate anything.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, you may not have meant to, but you did.\nIt sounds like you wanted to bring this relationship into crisis.\nI know you say that Andrew hates uncertainties but perhaps you're the one who can't live with them.\nWhy did you choose this particular time to bring things to a head?\n\n**Patient:**\nI did no such thing.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy now?\n\n**Patient:**\nCos he's right.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAndrew's right.\n\n**Patient:**\nI am being unfaithful to him.\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

I am your therapist.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo, are there any rules?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nEr, rules?\n\n**Patient:**\nGround rules.\nAnything I should know before we start?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh, not really.\nIt's more or less up to you.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, right, right. I'm a customer.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYeah.\nThough in my profession, we say that the customer is always wrong.\nIt's a... It's a therapist's joke.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo, do you recognise me?\nNo.\nI'm sorry, uh, should I?\nI was told you were the best, a man in tune with everything around him,\nso you should.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThank you.\nBut I do think that in this profession, \"the best\" is really a matter of personal opinion.\nNo, the best can be established by facts and figures.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou're the best. I did my research.\nCouple of former patients, someone who knew you from graduate school.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoes that pressure you?\nIs it important for you to know\nthat I am the best?\n\n**Patient:**\nYes.\nIt's nothing personal, I always go to the best - dentists, mechanics.\nYou know what they say - save now, pay later.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what do you think being the best therapist entails?\n\n**Patient:**\nDo you recognise me?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, I...\nI... I don't.\n\n**Patient:**\nLet me help.\nThe Madrasah Murderer.\nDoes that mean anything to you?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt wasn't that long ago.\nUS Navy aircraft hit a target on the outskirts of Baghdad.\nNaval Intelligence identified the structure as an insurgents' safe house, a bunker. Turns out it's a madrasah.\nLet me tell you what that is. It's an Islamic religious school.\nBoys like bees in a beehive studying the Koran.\n16 of them... dead.\nRings a bell?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes, I remember that, yes.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo, that's me.\nI flew that mission.\nThe Madrasah Murderer.\nSo, uh, do you surf the net?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, somehow... Well, it wasn't really somehow, it was...\n\n**Patient:**\nLet's call a spade a spade. A leak. Probably another intelligence fuck-up.\nAnyway, I was identified as the pilot in that mission and my photo was placed on fundamentalist websites.\nAnd I'm not talking Al Jazeera, I'm talking websites that are...\nasking for my head on a platter.\nOffering up the heavens and 40 virgins to anyone who will slit my throat from ear to ear.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHere, um...\n\n**Patient:**\nHere you are. It's not a recent photo. It's a photo taken when I was 18.\nOn a high-school trip to Europe, Holland.\nThat city with the miniatures. Ult... Utrecht.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUtrecht.\n\n**Patient:**\nRight.\nSo while I'm talking to you, a million fanatics are downloading my portrait and printing it out as a dartboard.\nSilly motherfuckers.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo, why have you come to see me?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhoa, whoa. We'll get to that.\nSo you're probably thinking, \"What's it like?\n\"He flew his mission, then he flew back \"and he saw the bodies of those children on CNN.\" You're probably trying to figure out what went through his head.\nLet me tell you, after that kind of mission, I don't watch CNN.\nI go to sleep.\nI'm dead tired.\nAnd you're probably dying to ask how I can sleep nights.\nOK, um...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow do you sleep?\n\n**Patient:**\nI sleep well, thank you very much, knowing it was mission accomplished and with great precision.\nI followed my orders, which were hit my target and hit it on time.\nTime and target. Do you know, we have to hit our targets within two seconds of the estimated time?\nIt's surgical. And that's one small window and I have never missed it.\nIf I had failed that task, I'd be in trouble with my superiors, with my conscience and with the system.\nBut I hit my target.\nSo, I sleep like a baby.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUm, h-how many...\nchildren...\ndied in this... in this mission?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe media puts it at 16.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd the air force?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe navy, Doctor, listen.\nThe navy says nothing and why should it?\nWe're not into body counts, we just hit targets.\nWe don't look back over our shoulder.\nWe do our thing so you can sit here in peace, talking to people for a living.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n So when did you hear that children had been killed?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe following afternoon. I heard it on the internet.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat exactly did you hear?\nAnything specifically that you remember?\n\n**Patient:**\nLike what? It's not like there's time in the day to be surfing the net, this was a moment, I got away.\nThere's a lot of stuff to keep me busy.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat kind of stuff?\n\n**Patient:**\nMission review, aerial photos, videos. Just data, stuff.\nPreparation versus execution.\nEvery tiny technical aspect of our flight is recorded and analysed by the man.\nThere's nowhere to hide. And that's the way it should be.\nIt's just stuff and more stuff.\nWhen my mother died, my father had a year's worth of stuff to deal with.\nLast will and testament, her office, garden, a lifetime of photo albums.\nAnd every time I talked to him, I'd ask how he was, expecting, uh...\nyou know, that... he'd break down.\nFinally.\n\"It never ends, Alex, it never ends. Your mother left such a mess.\n\"She didn't know she was gonna die.\" And that's all he said.\nAfter less than a year, he met another woman and got married, just like that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow did that make you feel?\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, surprised. A whole life together and not a single tear.\nMm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's interesting that you compare the death of your mother with this mission that you've just flown.\n\n**Patient:**\nThat's very clever of you.\nBut there's no relation whatsoever.\nMy mother's death was the most traumatic event in my life so far.\nThat mission was just another mission for Alex. There is no comparison.\nAnyway, look, that's over and I'm back now at my home base and now I'm on R&R.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat kind of things do you do for R&R?\n\n**Patient:**\nDon't try to get ahead of me.\nI'm a runner. I was a hell of a runner in high school and I'm still a good one for an old man. So, I run with my fairy friend.\nThis gay guy who could kick your ass at any sport.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd does he have a name, this friend?\n\n**Patient:**\nMm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDaniel.\n\n**Patient:**\nDaniel.\nWe've been running together for a long time, between six and ten miles.\nDepending on whether one of us is on his period. Only this time, I challenged him.\nIt was no good running in the Middle East, not for the US military, unless you want a bomb to blow your balls off!\nSo, I wanted to do some serious running. I said, \"Let's go for 15.\" After 15 miles, I said, \"20.\" He didn't want it.\nI said, \"OK, I'll go on my own.\" So, he followed.\nI said, \"You know, only six more and it's a marathon. Let's do it.\" He wanted to stop. Little bitch.\nBut I wasn't gonna stop.\nNo stop.\nWe were out of water, we were on fumes.\nAt 22 miles, I had a heart attack and died.\nA textbook case, straight out of med school.\nEnlargement of the left ventricle, in accordance with the family history on both sides, fatal.\nAccording to the EKG and according to statistics, I had a 97.3 per cent chance of dying.\nOr a 2.7 per cent chance of living. Anyway, dead.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou actually died?\n\n**Patient:**\nIn the clinical sense no pulse, no brain activity, total clinical death.\nBut here I am.\nNow I'm gonna disappoint you, Doctor.\nWanna know why I'm gonna disappoint you?\nLet me help you - the light, the tunnel, life flashing before my eyes.\nThat's what you're interested in, right?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, I wasn't actually thinking of that at all, but I am interested.\nTell me.\n\n**Patient:**\nI couldn't give a shit about it either.\nBut that's all everyone wanted to know about - my father, my wife.\nEveryone wanted to hear about the goddamn tunnel.\nJust such bullshit.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you feel that maybe you disappointed people by not having that experience?\nThat maybe in some way you failed to deliver the goods?\n\n**Patient:**\nNobody really knows what was going through my mind during those last few moments.\nAs soon as there was no more tunnel, no one was interested.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd what was going through your mind?\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, I knew what was happening, you can tell.\nAnd you're afraid it's the end.\nIn all that time until I lost consciousness...\nAll that time... I don't know, it was maybe seconds, maybe half a minute.\nAll that time I kept trying to figure out if I had a hard-on.\nI don't know how I remembered, it was something my grandmother told me, when I was in high school, and she said when Grandpa died, she found him lying naked in the bathtub with a huge erection.\nNow, he's... he was 92 years old.\nShe hadn't seen an erection like that in 20 years.\nShe liked it. She said that was God's final gift to a man.\nA dead man's boner. They call it angel lust.\nAnyway, I'm lying there thinking about that story.\nI know what's happening and I said to myself, \"God Almighty, just don't let me have an erection now, not a hard-on.\" Because if you had an erection, it would mean...\nThat would mean that I was dead.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd your friend Daniel was with you throughout this?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, resuscitation, CPR... Daniel's a doctor. I forgot to say that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh. For a minute I thought you were going to say something else, that perhaps your fear of an erection was associated with the presence of your friend, Daniel.\n\n**Patient:**\nExcuse me?\nYou're exaggerating. I explained something simple, a dead man's erection - what's that got to do with Daniel?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, maybe I didn't make myself clear earlier on when I was talking about the customer always being wrong.\nWhat I meant was that sometimes the patient hides things from his therapist, from himself.\nAnd so part of our job is to uncover the things that we hide.\n\n**Patient:**\n So, my secret is I'm afraid of homosexuals?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, not necessarily. But I just wanted to clarify that.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, that's neither here nor there. I want to get to my point.\nI didn't have the erection, so relax.\nBut I remember very vividly that moment just before passing out, before losing consciousness.\nLosing consciousness, that's a funny expression.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy do you think that's a funny expression?\n\n**Patient:**\nLosing consciousness - it's an expression my father would use.\nEverything in terms of profits and loss.\nFits him like a glove.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo something about how you describe your last moments is equated with your father's seeing things in terms of profit and loss?\n\n**Patient:**\nOK, OK, with all due respect, I think we've come to this way too early.\nThe father-son relationship stuff shouldn't come up so soon.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou think it's too soon?\n\n**Patient:**\nForget what I feel.\nI know it's too soon. I wanna know what you think.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you're... You're testing me?\n\n**Patient:**\nI'm entitled to some testing. I'm paying.\nActually, I think you've been testing me since you walked in.\nYou've asked about me and my reputation, you ask, you practically demand that I ask certain questions that you think I am dying to ask.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's important to you, I think, that I adhere to certain standards you set before you walked through the door.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat's wrong with that? Look, I did my research.\nIt's a 1  1/2 hour drive to get here and I'm paying you good money.\nAnd I'm expected to tell you, a perfect stranger, the most intimate things about my life.\nPlus there are risks here.\nIt's not like the navy's gonna give me a medal for spilling my guts, I'm not gonna open up to you without knowing what you are.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd what do you expect to find, Alex?\nHow are we going to know that I'm a good enough therapist for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nI'll know...\naccording to your opinion.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMy opinion of what?\n\n**Patient:**\nOf the issue I came to talk about.\nBut I'll come to that in a minute.\nIt's to do with what happened after taking me out of the freezer.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe freezer?\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, you mean that you were grounded?\nNo, literally frozen. They froze me.\nThe mobile intensive care unit arrived and put me in a suit that freezes you.\nThey got one no more than three-quarters of a mile from where I collapsed.\nAnd their ER is tops.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLet's go back to this...\n\n**Patient:**\nWe're getting there. You have no patience.\nI was told you're a good listener.\nNow look, it works on a very simple principle.\nIt reduces the shock to the body's systems by dropping the body temperature.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo how long were you...\n\n**Patient:**\nIn my case, 48 hours. It's a record.\nThere's no history of anyone who's been in that suit for such a long time.\nI guess I went a long way up that tunnel.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe tunnel that wasn't there?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, unfortunately not.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo tell me what you remember about this 48 hours.\n\n**Patient:**\nMostly I remember, um... a terrible fatigue.\nI guess that's why they call it \"dead tired\".\nIt's physical, but mainly mental exhaustion.\nAnd I remember very clearly the relief I felt when I succeeded in coming back over into the \nworld.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou say that you succeeded in coming back to this world.\nDid... Did you feel it was under your control?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat are you trying to get at?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'm not trying to get at anything.\nBut what you're describing is a strong will to live.\n\n**Patient:**\nDuring this experience, there was a decision to go on living.\nYeah, I guess you're right.\nDespite having made this effort to live...\neverybody's disappointed.\nIt's not every day people meet someone who's come back from the dead.\nIt's a one-in-a-million thing. And if you don't supply the goods, then...\nListen, I have never spent a day in my life in a hospital.\nYou get it? Never.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo, perhaps your anger isn't directed at those people interested in the tunnel.\nPerhaps you're angry at yourself, Alex. How your body betrayed you.\nThis is a systems failure that was not supposed to happen to somebody like you.\n\n**Patient:**\nHmh.\nI have a brother, who's not bright, he's a real-estate agent.\nAnyway, he's a great athlete. And he once proved to me, and he does his research, believe me...\nthat all the great quarterbacks in the history of football were also the best looking.\nNamath, Staubach, Cunningham, they're all good-Iooking people.\nThe best-Iooking students in the class are often great athletes.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou know why that is?\n\n**Patient:**\nI've no idea.\nIt's got nothing to do with sports.\nWhen they got their gift from God the Father, or whoever the hell doles out the talent, they got the whole package - beauty, talent, character.\nThat's how it is. It's an evolutionary thing.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo, how is your football?\n\n**Patient:**\nNah.\nFootball's not my game. Running, of course.\nWrestling. Pole vault, once upon a time.\nBut now, I am part of a military elite.\nAthletes may be popular, but we are the creme de la creme.\nYou have to understand, this is a person whose whole life was perfect.\nPeople in my line of work are born to excel, to be perfect.\nIt wasn't our choice, it was life that chose us to be the best.\nAnd what does that mean? \"Life chose us?\" Yeah, you don't become a fighter pilot suddenly at age 20.\nAt age seven or eight, when you're in the third grade, you know you're talented.\nYou know you're headed somewhere special, you are going to be the best and it all lays out right in front of you.\nTop grades, varsity letters, you name it.\nI'm a TOPGUN grad, you understand that? That training is not for pussies.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo if you don't achieve your personal best,\nare you disappointed in yourself?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, no, that's not...\nHow much longer do we have?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWe've got time. I'II...\nI'll tell you when it's... when it's time.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK, so here's my point, finally.\nI came to get your advice on something.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSure.\n\n**Patient:**\nI decided to go there. To the target.\nYou understand what I'm talking about here?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou mean to the site where you dropped the bomb, to the school?\n\n**Patient:**\nMadrasah. I wanna go back, take a look around.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhere the children were killed?\n\n**Patient:**\nI know what you're thinking, so let me straighten this out.\nI don't have a guilty conscience, I already told you that. I sleep very well.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBut why would you want to go back?\n\n**Patient:**\nI'm interested.\nFrom the moment I came out of that freezer, I knew I wanted to go back.\nIt came up in a conversation I had with Daniel when he visited me at the hospital.\nHe thinks I'm gonna freak out or something, he thinks it's a crazy thing to do.\nAnd he said I need to see someone first - psychologist, psychiatrist.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDon't you think it's dangerous?\n\n**Patient:**\nNot at all.\nI don't think anyone would recognise me.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBut your picture's on the internet.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo way. You saw the picture.\nIt's ridiculous. My mother wouldn't recognise me, not even Michaela.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWho's Michaela?\n\n**Patient:**\nMy wife.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat does she think of all this?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat's she got to do with it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDon't you talk with your wife?\n\n**Patient:**\nThis is not for me, all this \"What do you feel? What do you think?\" I asked you something, I came to you to consult about something specific.\nSo, you want me to tell you that this desire of yours to go back to where the bombing took place is a good thing?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOK, yeah, yeah. Yes.\nDo you want me to take responsibility for this visit?\n\n**Patient:**\nOK, don't make me into an idiot. Are you telling me I'm not taking responsibility?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, I'm just going back to something you said earlier on.\nRemember you said that life chose you to be a member of an elite, that it wasn't your decision?\nMaybe that's an attitude you're comfortable with.\nYou're comfortable with it because you don't have to make any decisions.\nIt relieves you of responsibility.\nYour commanding officer, he makes the decisions, conveys them to you and you execute them.\n\n**Patient:**\nWait, are you trying to tell me that I'm asking you to be my commanding officer?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOK, I'll buy it.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo, are you willing to... to be my CO?\nFor $150 an hour.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI don't think I'm... I don't think I'm qualified for that.\n\n**Patient:**\nBut would you agree to be your own commanding officer?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh, listen, you know what? Just leave it alone. I...\nI'm not gonna get anything useful out of you.\n\n**Patient:**\nAnd you're supposed to be the best?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'm not the best.\nMaybe you're the best. But I'm... I'm not.\nThink about the ramifications of what you're about to do.\nYou're going back to a place where you dropped a bomb, 16 children were killed, your face is on the internet and there's a price on your head.\n\n**Patient:**\nWait. Now you're saying you agree with Daniel, that I've gone crazy?\nHow would you feel if I did agree?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow hard is a straight answer?\n\n**Patient:**\nI got a plane to catch.\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

It gets, uh...\nIt gets stuck. Hi. I'm your therapist.\n\n**Patient:**\nSophie.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNice to meet you. Come on in.\n\n**Patient:**\nHere?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nDo you need any help with the...\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. It's OK.\nAnna Colden recommended that I talk to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnna Colden?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe's my lawyer. She heard about you from a friend of yours.\nI mean, a friend of hers, not a friend of yours.\nFrom a patient of yours who is a friend of hers. Sorry.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMm. So, Anna Colden recommended you through a patient.\n\n**Patient:**\nDo you know his name?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI don't know.\nSo what did Anna recommend me for?\n\n**Patient:**\nAfter my accident... I told you on the phone about the accident?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\n\n**Patient:**\nThey told me I need the opinion of a psychiatrist because the insurance company of the car that hit me has a problem with my injuries or...\nsomething like that. So that's why I'm here.\nI'm here for your professional opinion, not for...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNot for... Not for therapy?\nSo, let's see if I'm, uh... if I'm getting this right.\nAre you suing the insurance company of the person who hit you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Their insurance company had me talk to a social worker.\nAnd... she started asking me all sorts of annoying questions.\nShe was really annoying so I refused to talk to her.\nShe started talking to me like she knew me, so I refused to talk and that didn't go over so well, so my mother said it would be better if I came to talk to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nRight. So what happened at the accident that requires a psychiatric opinion?\n\n**Patient:**\nI really don't remember what happened.\nI was on my bicycle and a car ran into me and I don't remember what happened next.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat did they tell you afterwards?\n\n**Patient:**\nThat I flew my bike right into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're... You're laughing at that.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat that sounds like, flying straight into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you find that funny, yeah?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause it reminds me of something about two years ago.\nA... A friend of mine, he took me out on this motorbike and he stopped to get something at a convenience store.\nAnyway, I was really bored so I pretended that I knew how to drive it.\nYou put your hands on the handlebars and go like this.\nWell, it was one of those monster bikes.\nJust by turning the handle a little, it just flies.\nSo, suddenly, I'm like, zoom, and it takes off.\nMy head, it whips back like this and when I look down, I realise I'm riding into the street.\nTotally crashed into a car.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nThere was this old woman standing nearby and she saw all this. \"I saw her. She did it on purpose.\n\"She tried to kill herself. She tried to kill herself.\" That's what she was yelling?\nYeah, she was like a crazy woman.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\nCourse, it couldn't have been that funny when it happened, I'm sure?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Not really.\nI wanted to kill her. I was just lying there.\nI couldn't move. I couldn't do anything.\nI wanted to yell, \"Shut up, you... you idiot.\n\"Why are you screaming?\" You know? But I couldn't speak.\nIt's like this feeling...\nwhen somebody says something about you and you can't defend yourself.\nIt's totally unfair.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLike that social worker you were talking about.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat does she have to do with it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, didn't you feel that she was speaking for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, but I could have said something.\nI just didn't want to.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHm.\nSo, tell me a little more about this, uh, this accident.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's all in that report.\n\nWhere did it happen?\n\n**Patient:**\nIn a gas station on Madison near the gym where I train.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you were on the way to the gym?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. I told you I don't remember anything.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you feel comfortable talking about yourself, Sophie?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nMy name is Sophie. I'm 16 years old.\nI've been a gymnast since the age of six and a half.\nI was US junior champion at the age of 12.\nI'm an only child.\nI don't know. What do you wanna know?\nIn another few months are the national trials.\nLast chance to qualify for the Olympics.\nI'm kind of like... an Olympic hopeful.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWow.\nThat's really impressive. Congratulations.\n\n**Patient:**\nThank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo how is life in general?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, apart from the gymnastics.\nHow's life?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's great.\nI just don't have the energy for This Is Your Life right now.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThis Is Your Life? What do... What do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nYou know, like the TV show.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're way too young to know about that show.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's on DVD. My mom's friend watches it all the time.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you think of it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's OK.\nSome of the people on it are so old.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n Why do you think they put old people on that?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Cos they have nothing better to do?\nThey're retired and dying off fast so they put them on the show before it's too late.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo do you think you can help me with this professional opinion or not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's not that simple, Sophie.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause it's not like an X-ray where you can take photographs, look at the results and then you go on your way.\nIt doesn't quite work like that.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nOK, so I guess I'll leave.\nWould you at least like to read what it says in the report?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIf you want me to.\n\n**Patient:**\nLike you already know what it says?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. I've no idea what it says.\n\n**Patient:**\nListen, I didn't come here to talk about myself.\nI just need your opinion.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you want me to give you my opinion based on what I read and the conversation that we've had today, is that it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIs that a problem?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. No.\nI'll write up an opinion and, um...\nwhen you come next week, you can decide whether you want to use it or not.\n\n**Patient:**\nJust like that, without any more questions?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, what kind of questions do you want me to ask?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Shrink-like questions.\nSay, about Mom, Dad, that kind of thing?\nDoesn't sound like you're interested.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy would you say that, Sophie?\nI am very interested in everything that you have to say.\nI mean that.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou spoke to my mother already, didn't you?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI didn't.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou already know what it says in there.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI've never spoken to her.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou did and you're letting me sit here and you know exactly what's in that envelope.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWas I... Was I supposed to talk to her?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat, did you, like, plan everything?\nLike I'm some kind of idiot, you planned some charade?\nWhat's the point? Whatever. She would send me to someone like you.\nI should have listened to my father. He called them a cult of crazies.\nOpen the door for me, please.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd if I did speak to your mom?\n\n**Patient:**\nI knew it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, then?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt means you're a liar, OK?\nCos I know how it's supposed to work.\nYou're supposed to read that report and ask the stupid shrink questions you ask.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoesn't it seems unprofessional to so not do it that way?\nMaybe I have something to say about what it says in there.\nI just wanted to read the report by myself before our meeting next week. That's all.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat meeting next week?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'd like us to meet three or four times for me to form an opinion of you, to get to know you a little.\nDon't you think?\nOtherwise... it wouldn't be professional.\nHm?\nI'll read it now.\nOK?\nSo are all these ships instead of sailing for real?\n\n**Patient:**\nUh-huh.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAt least you won't get seasick.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh...\nI don't know about that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nSometimes I can get quite wobbly just sitting right here.\nYou have to make a round window to the outside.\nThen you'll feel like you're in a real ship.\nDid you really read all those books or is it just to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUh-huh.\n\n**Patient:**\nYes, you read them or yes, you're trying to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nI've read them.\nI feel sorry for the books up there.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh. Why do you feel sorry for them?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhere would you put them?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. They're your fucking books.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou suffer from asthma.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. How do you know that?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThere's an inhaler here.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, thanks. I've been looking everywhere for that. Thank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, you could have died without it?\nAccording to what it says here...\nit looks like you could have died too.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. That would have solved a lot of problems.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat would it solve?\n\n**Patient:**\nNothing. I didn't mean anything by it.\nCan I talk to you like a normal person?\nDo you drive your daughter crazy with questions like this too?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMuch more crazy, believe me.\nHow d'you know I had a daughter?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause you do.\nYou know my mother.\nYou were on the PTA committee at Arlington elementary.\nI was there before I went off to a private school.\nI was in the same year as your daughter.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, why didn't you tell me that before?\n\n**Patient:**\nHm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou said that the, uh... that the social worker spoke to you like she knew you.\n\n**Patient:**\nShe was such a retard.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDid she ask you if, um... if you think about death a lot?\n\n**Patient:**\nHow did you know that?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAccording to what it says here, she was trying to prove that the accident was your fault.\nIt's a good thing you didn't answer any of her questions.\nBy the way, everybody thinks about death.\nI bet she didn't say that, though.\nDid she ask you if you had any specific thoughts about death?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you?\n\n**Patient:**\nDo I what?\nEveryone... Everyone thinks about death and, uh...\nimagines how it will come to them.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you have any more specific thoughts about it?\nI mean, maybe you have certain thoughts that you'd like to talk about.\n\n**Patient:**\nUnless you're worried about what I...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'm not worried.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nIs this how it's going to be for three appointments?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs this a little difficult for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nCan I have some water?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSure.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHang on a minute.\nSorry about this. It's for my little patients, the elves.\nIt's a bendy one.\nYou need help with that?\nMust be really hard to be, uh... be handicapped like that.\nWhat's the hardest thing about it?\n\n**Patient:**\nEveryone treats me like a baby.\nHm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDid you come here by yourself today?\n\n**Patient:**\nYes. By bus.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYour mom didn't offer to drive you?\nYeah, right. She knew there was no chance I'd say yes.\nBefore, when you got angry, when, uh...\nwhen you thought that she'd called me, I asked myself, \"Why didn't she call?\" It makes sense that she would call me first.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI don't... What do you mean?\nI'm trying to figure out why you got so angry when you thought...\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't get it. She did call?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, no.\n\n**Patient:**\nDid she call or not? Tell me already.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, she didn't call.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo why are we back to this again?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause I got the feeling that when you got angry, you wanted your mother to call, just so that \nyou could get angry with her.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou have no idea what I'm looking for.\nYou just don't get it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOK.\nSo...\nwhy don't you explain it to me, then?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe thinks that what's written there is true.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat's true?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhatever it says. \"Suicidal tendencies\", blah, blah, blah.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThat's what your mother says is true?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe thinks that this accident is an opportunity to get rid of the sports thing.\nThat's what she calls it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBut what does that have to do with this report?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe's afraid.\nShe doesn't believe that...\nShe thinks that, because of all this competition and perfectionism, she thinks that I wanted to kill myself. And that's bullshit.\nIt's been like this for years.\nI've been under pressure for years and she has never supported me.\nAll the other mothers are right there, all over us, visiting the gym, the training camps, all of it.\nAnd the only thing she has to say is, \"What do you need this for?\" It's obvious she doesn't understand anything.\nAll this pressure, it doesn't make any difference.\nIt's so silly. Why would I hurt myself now, just before the nationals when I have all the...\nAnd if I fail the lawsuit, I really have no chance.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you mean, fail?

Are you worried that I won't be available?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo.\n\n**Patient:**\nAre you this much of a pain in the ass with your daughter?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMuch, much worse, believe me.\nAnd yes, I do try to understand my daughter, if that's what you're asking.\n\n**Patient:**\nThat's not what I'm asking.\nLet's say she wants to talk to you now.\nWhat will she do? I don't think she'll wait till ten to so she can talk to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWho do you call, Sophie?\n\n**Patient:**\nNow you don't feel comfortable talking about your daughter.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nShe calls me at ten minutes before the hour, she leaves a message and I get back to her.\nBut who do you call?\n\n**Patient:**\nWho do I call for what?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhen you need to talk to someone.\n\n**Patient:**\nFour, one, one.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nFour, one, one?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah.\nHe's my father. He's moved so many times in the past few years, I can never remember his latest phone number.\nIt's like a family joke. We call four, one, one.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow do you get on with your dad?\n\n**Patient:**\nHe's always there for me.\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

Come on in.\n\n**Patient:**\nHere?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nDo you need any help with the...\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. It's OK.\nAnna Colden recommended that I talk to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnna Colden?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe's my lawyer. She heard about you from a friend of yours.\nI mean, a friend of hers, not a friend of yours.\nFrom a patient of yours who is a friend of hers. Sorry.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMm. So, Anna Colden recommended you through a patient.\n\n**Patient:**\nDo you know his name?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI don't know.\nSo what did Anna recommend me for?\n\n**Patient:**\nAfter my accident... I told you on the phone about the accident?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\n\n**Patient:**\nThey told me I need the opinion of a psychiatrist because the insurance company of the car that hit me has a problem with my injuries or...\nsomething like that. So that's why I'm here.\nI'm here for your professional opinion, not for...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNot for... Not for therapy?\nSo, let's see if I'm, uh... if I'm getting this right.\nAre you suing the insurance company of the person who hit you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Their insurance company had me talk to a social worker.\nAnd... she started asking me all sorts of annoying questions.\nShe was really annoying so I refused to talk to her.\nShe started talking to me like she knew me, so I refused to talk and that didn't go over so well, so my mother said it would be better if I came to talk to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nRight. So what happened at the accident that requires a psychiatric opinion?\n\n**Patient:**\nI really don't remember what happened.\nI was on my bicycle and a car ran into me and I don't remember what happened next.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat did they tell you afterwards?\n\n**Patient:**\nThat I flew my bike right into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're... You're laughing at that.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat that sounds like, flying straight into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you find that funny, yeah?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause it reminds me of something about two years ago.\nA... A friend of mine, he took me out on this motorbike and he stopped to get something at a convenience store.\nAnyway, I was really bored so I pretended that I knew how to drive it.\nYou put your hands on the handlebars and go like this.\nWell, it was one of those monster bikes.\nJust by turning the handle a little, it just flies.\nSo, suddenly, I'm like, zoom, and it takes off.\nMy head, it whips back like this and when I look down, I realise I'm riding into the street.\nTotally crashed into a car.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nThere was this old woman standing nearby and she saw all this. \"I saw her. She did it on purpose.\n\"She tried to kill herself. She tried to kill herself.\" That's what she was yelling?\nYeah, she was like a crazy woman.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\nCourse, it couldn't have been that funny when it happened, I'm sure?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Not really.\nI wanted to kill her. I was just lying there.\nI couldn't move. I couldn't do anything.\nI wanted to yell, \"Shut up, you... you idiot.\n\"Why are you screaming?\" You know? But I couldn't speak.\nIt's like this feeling...\nwhen somebody says something about you and you can't defend yourself.\nIt's totally unfair.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLike that social worker you were talking about.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat does she have to do with it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, didn't you feel that she was speaking for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, but I could have said something.\nI just didn't want to.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHm.\nSo, tell me a little more about this, uh, this accident.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's all in that report.\n\nWhere did it happen?\n\n**Patient:**\nIn a gas station on Madison near the gym where I train.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you were on the way to the gym?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. I told you I don't remember anything.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you feel comfortable talking about yourself, Sophie?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nMy name is Sophie. I'm 16 years old.\nI've been a gymnast since the age of six and a half.\nI was US junior champion at the age of 12.\nI'm an only child.\nI don't know. What do you wanna know?\nIn another few months are the national trials.\nLast chance to qualify for the Olympics.\nI'm kind of like... an Olympic hopeful.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWow.\nThat's really impressive. Congratulations.\n\n**Patient:**\nThank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo how is life in general?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, apart from the gymnastics.\nHow's life?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's great.\nI just don't have the energy for This Is Your Life right now.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThis Is Your Life? What do... What do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nYou know, like the TV show.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're way too young to know about that show.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's on DVD. My mom's friend watches it all the time.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you think of it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's OK.\nSome of the people on it are so old.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n Why do you think they put old people on that?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Cos they have nothing better to do?\nThey're retired and dying off fast so they put them on the show before it's too late.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo do you think you can help me with this professional opinion or not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's not that simple, Sophie.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause it's not like an X-ray where you can take photographs, look at the results and then you go on your way.\nIt doesn't quite work like that.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nOK, so I guess I'll leave.\nWould you at least like to read what it says in the report?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIf you want me to.\n\n**Patient:**\nLike you already know what it says?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. I've no idea what it says.\n\n**Patient:**\nListen, I didn't come here to talk about myself.\nI just need your opinion.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you want me to give you my opinion based on what I read and the conversation that we've had today, is that it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIs that a problem?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. No.\nI'll write up an opinion and, um...\nwhen you come next week, you can decide whether you want to use it or not.\n\n**Patient:**\nJust like that, without any more questions?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, what kind of questions do you want me to ask?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Shrink-like questions.\nSay, about Mom, Dad, that kind of thing?\nDoesn't sound like you're interested.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy would you say that, Sophie?\nI am very interested in everything that you have to say.\nI mean that.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou spoke to my mother already, didn't you?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI didn't.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou already know what it says in there.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI've never spoken to her.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou did and you're letting me sit here and you know exactly what's in that envelope.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWas I... Was I supposed to talk to her?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat, did you, like, plan everything?\nLike I'm some kind of idiot, you planned some charade?\nWhat's the point? Whatever. She would send me to someone like you.\nI should have listened to my father. He called them a cult of crazies.\nOpen the door for me, please.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd if I did speak to your mom?\n\n**Patient:**\nI knew it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, then?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt means you're a liar, OK?\nCos I know how it's supposed to work.\nYou're supposed to read that report and ask the stupid shrink questions you ask.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoesn't it seems unprofessional to so not do it that way?\nMaybe I have something to say about what it says in there.\nI just wanted to read the report by myself before our meeting next week. That's all.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat meeting next week?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'd like us to meet three or four times for me to form an opinion of you, to get to know you a little.\nDon't you think?\nOtherwise... it wouldn't be professional.\nHm?\nI'll read it now.\nOK?\nSo are all these ships instead of sailing for real?\n\n**Patient:**\nUh-huh.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAt least you won't get seasick.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh...\nI don't know about that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nSometimes I can get quite wobbly just sitting right here.\nYou have to make a round window to the outside.\nThen you'll feel like you're in a real ship.\nDid you really read all those books or is it just to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUh-huh.\n\n**Patient:**\nYes, you read them or yes, you're trying to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nI've read them.\nI feel sorry for the books up there.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh. Why do you feel sorry for them?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhere would you put them?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. They're your fucking books.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou suffer from asthma.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. How do you know that?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThere's an inhaler here.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, thanks. I've been looking everywhere for that. Thank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, you could have died without it?\nAccording to what it says here...\nit looks like you could have died too.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. That would have solved a lot of problems.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat would it solve?\n\n**Patient:**\nNothing. I didn't mean anything by it.\nCan I talk to you like a normal person?\nDo you drive your daughter crazy with questions like this too?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMuch more crazy, believe me.\nHow d'you know I had a daughter?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause you do.\nYou know my mother.\nYou were on the PTA committee at Arlington elementary.\nI was there before I went off to a private school.\nI was in the same year as your daughter.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, why didn't you tell me that before?\n\n**Patient:**\nHm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou said that the, uh... that the social worker spoke to you like she knew you.\n\n**Patient:**\nShe was such a retard.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDid she ask you if, um... if you think about death a lot?\n\n**Patient:**\nHow did you know that?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAccording to what it says here, she was trying to prove that the accident was your fault.\nIt's a good thing you didn't answer any of her questions.\nBy the way, everybody thinks about death.\nI bet she didn't say that, though.\nDid she ask you if you had any specific thoughts about death?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you?\n\n**Patient:**\nDo I what?\nEveryone... Everyone thinks about death and, uh...\nimagines how it will come to them.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you have any more specific thoughts about it?\nI mean, maybe you have certain thoughts that you'd like to talk about.\n\n**Patient:**\nUnless you're worried about what I...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'm not worried.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nIs this how it's going to be for three appointments?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs this a little difficult for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nCan I have some water?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSure.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHang on a minute.\nSorry about this. It's for my little patients, the elves.\nIt's a bendy one.\nYou need help with that?\nMust be really hard to be, uh... be handicapped like that.\nWhat's the hardest thing about it?\n\n**Patient:**\nEveryone treats me like a baby.\nHm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDid you come here by yourself today?\n\n**Patient:**\nYes. By bus.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYour mom didn't offer to drive you?\nYeah, right. She knew there was no chance I'd say yes.\nBefore, when you got angry, when, uh...\nwhen you thought that she'd called me, I asked myself, \"Why didn't she call?\" It makes sense that she would call me first.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI don't... What do you mean?\nI'm trying to figure out why you got so angry when you thought...\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't get it. She did call?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, no.\n\n**Patient:**\nDid she call or not? Tell me already.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, she didn't call.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo why are we back to this again?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause I got the feeling that when you got angry, you wanted your mother to call, just so that \nyou could get angry with her.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou have no idea what I'm looking for.\nYou just don't get it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOK.\nSo...\nwhy don't you explain it to me, then?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe thinks that what's written there is true.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat's true?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhatever it says. \"Suicidal tendencies\", blah, blah, blah.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThat's what your mother says is true?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe thinks that this accident is an opportunity to get rid of the sports thing.\nThat's what she calls it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBut what does that have to do with this report?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe's afraid.\nShe doesn't believe that...\nShe thinks that, because of all this competition and perfectionism, she thinks that I wanted to kill myself. And that's bullshit.\nIt's been like this for years.\nI've been under pressure for years and she has never supported me.\nAll the other mothers are right there, all over us, visiting the gym, the training camps, all of it.\nAnd the only thing she has to say is, \"What do you need this for?\" It's obvious she doesn't understand anything.\nAll this pressure, it doesn't make any difference.\nIt's so silly. Why would I hurt myself now, just before the nationals when I have all the...\nAnd if I fail the lawsuit, I really have no chance.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you mean, fail? Do you see this as a kind of test?\nTell me, why do you...\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy are you making it sound like it's...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat?\n\n**Patient:**\nI didn't come here for therapy.\nI just need you to write your opinion and tell me that I'm perfectly all right and tell them that I'm not some crazy who flies into cars every day.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs that why you came here today, Sophie?\nFor me to tell you that you're all right, that you're not crazy?\nIs that the test you're afraid of failing?\n\n**Patient:**\nI have to go.\nIt's ten to already.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou probably have to turn on your cellphone now.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy? Are you worried that I won't be available?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo.\n\n**Patient:**\nAre you this much of a pain in the ass with your daughter?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMuch, much worse, believe me.\nAnd yes, I do try to understand my daughter, if that's what you're asking.\n\n**Patient:**\nThat's not what I'm asking.\nLet's say she wants to talk to you now.\nWhat will she do?

Of course you wouldn't.\nBut we did actually talk about it yesterday, right after I said yes, we started making a guest list and for a few minutes you were on it.\nWait a minute, you said yes just yesterday?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYeah.\nI couldn't make up my mind.\nIt took me a few days to get over the other night and our session.\nI, uh... I wanted to calm down first.\n\n**Patient:**\nAndrew was cool, he said a day here or there wouldn't matter as long as I was moving towards a decision.\nYou know, he's very happy that you're helping me.\nFor a while there, he thought he'd made a mistake recommending that I come see you.\nHe thinks you're an amazing therapist and that his instincts were just right, and that you're on our side.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat?\nUh...

So don't.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nJoy is a very rare thing when it comes to me.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'm...\nI'm just wondering if you came here today determined to, uh...\ndemonstrate that joy, especially after last week's events.\nI'm asking myself if this isn't a bit too fast, if you haven't perhaps taken a short cut.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou think that I'm faking this?

Well, w-we used to.\n\n**Patient:**\nOoh, who's speaking in the plural now?\nI can't imagine you diving.\nWhere'd you go? Mexico? The Caribbean?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAre you interested in...\nscuba diving?\n\n**Patient:**\nI'm a certified diver.\nI know what the bends are.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSorry.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, seriously, I dove a lot before I met Andrew.\nHe hates it and he's claustrophobic.\nIt's nice to find we have something in common, you and me, isn't it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhere are you now, Laura?\n\n**Patient:**\nI just had a scary thought. I just, um...\nI know it's silly but...\nbeforehand when you said your...\nyour lungs could explode, it was just the thought that something might happen to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYet you're the one who ascended so fast.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou know what, Doctor? I don't want a depressing session.\nI want a happy session. I came with good news, so show a little support.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOK.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK, yesterday, um, I was at Natalie's, you know, Andrew's ex, and Gary, the husband. The ones who had a baby a few months ago.\nThey keep inviting us over and I keep avoiding them but yesterday they invited us for brunch...\nAnyway, Gary makes dim sum. He has those bamboo steamers and everything.\nSo I said to Andrew, \"OK, let's go.\" He's been so sweet all week, I thought it was the least I could do.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo his agreeing to postpone the ultimatum, that...\ndisarmed you?\nAll right. Go ahead.\n\n**Patient:**\nThey have a baby. These huge eyes.\nThe baby is all eyes, so beautiful.\nAnd the way he breast-feeds, all morning he was attached to Natalie's nipple, this huge dark nipple - I've never seen anything like it.\nAt one point she took her boob out of the baby's mouth and squeezed it and some milk squirted out.\nAnd Andrew has this admiring smile on his face, you know, like he was looking at some masterpiece in a museum, like the Madonna.\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

I am your therapist.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo, are there any rules?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nEr, rules?\n\n**Patient:**\nGround rules.\nAnything I should know before we start?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh, not really.\nIt's more or less up to you.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, right, right. I'm a customer.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYeah.\nThough in my profession, we say that the customer is always wrong.\nIt's a... It's a therapist's joke.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo, do you recognise me?\nNo.\nI'm sorry, uh, should I?\nI was told you were the best, a man in tune with everything around him,\nso you should.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThank you.\nBut I do think that in this profession, \"the best\" is really a matter of personal opinion.\nNo, the best can be established by facts and figures.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou're the best. I did my research.\nCouple of former patients, someone who knew you from graduate school.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoes that pressure you?\nIs it important for you to know\nthat I am the best?\n\n**Patient:**\nYes.\nIt's nothing personal, I always go to the best - dentists, mechanics.\nYou know what they say - save now, pay later.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what do you think being the best therapist entails?\n\n**Patient:**\nDo you recognise me?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, I...\nI... I don't.\n\n**Patient:**\nLet me help.\nThe Madrasah Murderer.\nDoes that mean anything to you?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt wasn't that long ago.\nUS Navy aircraft hit a target on the outskirts of Baghdad.\nNaval Intelligence identified the structure as an insurgents' safe house, a bunker. Turns out it's a madrasah.\nLet me tell you what that is. It's an Islamic religious school.\nBoys like bees in a beehive studying the Koran.\n16 of them... dead.\nRings a bell?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes, I remember that, yes.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo, that's me.\nI flew that mission.\nThe Madrasah Murderer.\nSo, uh, do you surf the net?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, somehow... Well, it wasn't really somehow, it was...\n\n**Patient:**\nLet's call a spade a spade. A leak. Probably another intelligence fuck-up.\nAnyway, I was identified as the pilot in that mission and my photo was placed on fundamentalist websites.\nAnd I'm not talking Al Jazeera, I'm talking websites that are...\nasking for my head on a platter.\nOffering up the heavens and 40 virgins to anyone who will slit my throat from ear to ear.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHere, um...\n\n**Patient:**\nHere you are. It's not a recent photo. It's a photo taken when I was 18.\nOn a high-school trip to Europe, Holland.\nThat city with the miniatures. Ult... Utrecht.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUtrecht.\n\n**Patient:**\nRight.\nSo while I'm talking to you, a million fanatics are downloading my portrait and printing it out as a dartboard.\nSilly motherfuckers.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo, why have you come to see me?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhoa, whoa. We'll get to that.\nSo you're probably thinking, \"What's it like?\n\"He flew his mission, then he flew back \"and he saw the bodies of those children on CNN.\" You're probably trying to figure out what went through his head.\nLet me tell you, after that kind of mission, I don't watch CNN.\nI go to sleep.\nI'm dead tired.\nAnd you're probably dying to ask how I can sleep nights.\nOK, um...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow do you sleep?\n\n**Patient:**\nI sleep well, thank you very much, knowing it was mission accomplished and with great precision.\nI followed my orders, which were hit my target and hit it on time.\nTime and target. Do you know, we have to hit our targets within two seconds of the estimated time?\nIt's surgical. And that's one small window and I have never missed it.\nIf I had failed that task, I'd be in trouble with my superiors, with my conscience and with the system.\nBut I hit my target.\nSo, I sleep like a baby.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUm, h-how many...\nchildren...\ndied in this... in this mission?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe media puts it at 16.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd the air force?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe navy, Doctor, listen.\nThe navy says nothing and why should it?\nWe're not into body counts, we just hit targets.\nWe don't look back over our shoulder.\nWe do our thing so you can sit here in peace, talking to people for a living.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n So when did you hear that children had been killed?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe following afternoon. I heard it on the internet.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat exactly did you hear?\nAnything specifically that you remember?\n\n**Patient:**\nLike what? It's not like there's time in the day to be surfing the net, this was a moment, I got away.\nThere's a lot of stuff to keep me busy.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat kind of stuff?\n\n**Patient:**\nMission review, aerial photos, videos. Just data, stuff.\nPreparation versus execution.\nEvery tiny technical aspect of our flight is recorded and analysed by the man.\nThere's nowhere to hide. And that's the way it should be.\nIt's just stuff and more stuff.\nWhen my mother died, my father had a year's worth of stuff to deal with.\nLast will and testament, her office, garden, a lifetime of photo albums.\nAnd every time I talked to him, I'd ask how he was, expecting, uh...\nyou know, that... he'd break down.\nFinally.\n\"It never ends, Alex, it never ends. Your mother left such a mess.\n\"She didn't know she was gonna die.\" And that's all he said.\nAfter less than a year, he met another woman and got married, just like that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow did that make you feel?\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, surprised. A whole life together and not a single tear.\nMm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's interesting that you compare the death of your mother with this mission that you've just flown.\n\n**Patient:**\nThat's very clever of you.\nBut there's no relation whatsoever.\nMy mother's death was the most traumatic event in my life so far.\nThat mission was just another mission for Alex. There is no comparison.\nAnyway, look, that's over and I'm back now at my home base and now I'm on R&R.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat kind of things do you do for R&R?\n\n**Patient:**\nDon't try to get ahead of me.\nI'm a runner. I was a hell of a runner in high school and I'm still a good one for an old man. So, I run with my fairy friend.\nThis gay guy who could kick your ass at any sport.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd does he have a name, this friend?\n\n**Patient:**\nMm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDaniel.\n\n**Patient:**\nDaniel.\nWe've been running together for a long time, between six and ten miles.\nDepending on whether one of us is on his period. Only this time, I challenged him.\nIt was no good running in the Middle East, not for the US military, unless you want a bomb to blow your balls off!\nSo, I wanted to do some serious running. I said, \"Let's go for 15.\" After 15 miles, I said, \"20.\" He didn't want it.\nI said, \"OK, I'll go on my own.\" So, he followed.\nI said, \"You know, only six more and it's a marathon. Let's do it.\" He wanted to stop. Little bitch.\nBut I wasn't gonna stop.\nNo stop.\nWe were out of water, we were on fumes.\nAt 22 miles, I had a heart attack and died.\nA textbook case, straight out of med school.\nEnlargement of the left ventricle, in accordance with the family history on both sides, fatal.\nAccording to the EKG and according to statistics, I had a 97.3 per cent chance of dying.\nOr a 2.7 per cent chance of living. Anyway, dead.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou actually died?\n\n**Patient:**\nIn the clinical sense no pulse, no brain activity, total clinical death.\nBut here I am.\nNow I'm gonna disappoint you, Doctor.\nWanna know why I'm gonna disappoint you?\nLet me help you - the light, the tunnel, life flashing before my eyes.\nThat's what you're interested in, right?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, I wasn't actually thinking of that at all, but I am interested.\nTell me.\n\n**Patient:**\nI couldn't give a shit about it either.\nBut that's all everyone wanted to know about - my father, my wife.\nEveryone wanted to hear about the goddamn tunnel.\nJust such bullshit.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you feel that maybe you disappointed people by not having that experience?\nThat maybe in some way you failed to deliver the goods?\n\n**Patient:**\nNobody really knows what was going through my mind during those last few moments.\nAs soon as there was no more tunnel, no one was interested.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd what was going through your mind?\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, I knew what was happening, you can tell.\nAnd you're afraid it's the end.\nIn all that time until I lost consciousness...\nAll that time... I don't know, it was maybe seconds, maybe half a minute.\nAll that time I kept trying to figure out if I had a hard-on.\nI don't know how I remembered, it was something my grandmother told me, when I was in high school, and she said when Grandpa died, she found him lying naked in the bathtub with a huge erection.\nNow, he's... he was 92 years old.\nShe hadn't seen an erection like that in 20 years.\nShe liked it. She said that was God's final gift to a man.\nA dead man's boner. They call it angel lust.\nAnyway, I'm lying there thinking about that story.\nI know what's happening and I said to myself, \"God Almighty, just don't let me have an erection now, not a hard-on.\" Because if you had an erection, it would mean...\nThat would mean that I was dead.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd your friend Daniel was with you throughout this?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, resuscitation, CPR... Daniel's a doctor. I forgot to say that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh. For a minute I thought you were going to say something else, that perhaps your fear of an erection was associated with the presence of your friend, Daniel.\n\n**Patient:**\nExcuse me?\nYou're exaggerating. I explained something simple, a dead man's erection - what's that got to do with Daniel?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, maybe I didn't make myself clear earlier on when I was talking about the customer always being wrong.\nWhat I meant was that sometimes the patient hides things from his therapist, from himself.\nAnd so part of our job is to uncover the things that we hide.\n\n**Patient:**\n So, my secret is I'm afraid of homosexuals?\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

Your wife too.\nBut you wouldn't come, would you? Of course you wouldn't.\nBut we did actually talk about it yesterday, right after I said yes, we started making a guest list and for a few minutes you were on it.\nWait a minute, you said yes just yesterday?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYeah.\nI couldn't make up my mind.\nIt took me a few days to get over the other night and our session.\nI, uh... I wanted to calm down first.\n\n**Patient:**\nAndrew was cool, he said a day here or there wouldn't matter as long as I was moving towards a decision.\nYou know, he's very happy that you're helping me.\nFor a while there, he thought he'd made a mistake recommending that I come see you.\nHe thinks you're an amazing therapist and that his instincts were just right, and that you're on our side.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat?\nUh... I guess I'm just trying to get used to...\nto the change in tone.\nYou're speaking in the plural.\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, I'm gonna be a \"we\", an \"us\", aren't I?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou say that like you're not so sure.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, I'm sure.\nYou know, Doctor, I'm generally open to your interpretations, but it just seems like you're being a bit of a...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nKilljoy?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, something like that. So don't.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nJoy is a very rare thing when it comes to me.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'm...\nI'm just wondering if you came here today determined to, uh...\ndemonstrate that joy, especially after last week's events.\nI'm asking myself if this isn't a bit too fast, if you haven't perhaps taken a short cut.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou think that I'm faking this? That I'm actually totally depressed?\nWell, maybe it's you that's faking it, huh?\nI mean, that congratulations was a bit laboured, don't you think?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI...\nI don't know if you know anything about, um, scuba diving.\nThey have this thing that's called the bends.\nIt's something that happens when the divers come up to the surface too quickly.\nIt's really dangerous.\nIt can explode your lungs from the sudden changes in pressure.\nAnyway, it...\nit seems like there's... there's a huge gap between...\nthe depths that you reached last week and the heights...\nat which you are today. I'm just trying to...\nI'm just trying to adjust myself so that I don't, uh...\nI guess, come to the surface too quickly.\n\n**Patient:**\nDo you dive, Doctor?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nI... Well, w-we used to.\n\n**Patient:**\nOoh, who's speaking in the plural now?\nI can't imagine you diving.\nWhere'd you go? Mexico? The Caribbean?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAre you interested in...\nscuba diving?\n\n**Patient:**\nI'm a certified diver.\nI know what the bends are.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSorry.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, seriously, I dove a lot before I met Andrew.\nHe hates it and he's claustrophobic.\nIt's nice to find we have something in common, you and me, isn't it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhere are you now, Laura?\n\n**Patient:**\nI just had a scary thought. I just, um...\nI know it's silly but...\nbeforehand when you said your...\nyour lungs could explode, it was just the thought that something might happen to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYet you're the one who ascended so fast.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou know what, Doctor? I don't want a depressing session.\nI want a happy session. I came with good news, so show a little support.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOK.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK, yesterday, um, I was at Natalie's, you know, Andrew's ex, and Gary, the husband. The ones who had a baby a few months ago.\nThey keep inviting us over and I keep avoiding them but yesterday they invited us for brunch...\nAnyway, Gary makes dim sum. He has those bamboo steamers and everything.\nSo I said to Andrew, \"OK, let's go.\" He's been so sweet all week, I thought it was the least I could do.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo his agreeing to postpone the ultimatum, that...\ndisarmed you?\nAll right. Go ahead.\n\n**Patient:**\nThey have a baby. These huge eyes.\nThe baby is all eyes, so beautiful.\nAnd the way he breast-feeds, all morning he was attached to Natalie's nipple, this huge dark nipple - I've never seen anything like it.\nAt one point she took her boob out of the baby's mouth and squeezed it and some milk squirted out.\nAnd Andrew has this admiring smile on his face, you know, like he was looking at some masterpiece in a museum, like the Madonna.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you think he saw?\nMaybe an image of you and he together in the future, maybe?\n\n**Patient:**\nOr maybe he just misses her tits.\nNo, not really. They're not that nice.\nShe's changed since she had the baby.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIn what way?\n\n**Patient:**\nI didn't really know her before but Andrew told me a lot about her.\nHe said she was this wild type, you know, who had a lot of guys chasing her.\nShe put him through hell. He said they'd go to bed and she'd be one person, they'd wake up and she'd be someone totally new.\nA free radical, that's what he used to call her.\nHe says I remind him of her.\nThat's scary. Like this is what's left of her, her T-shirt's soaking wet and nipples - nipples, that's all that's left.\nShe's like a wild animal that's somehow been...\nShit, what's the word?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDomesticated?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, she looked domesticated, house-broken.\nShe said her wildest sexual fantasy was to sleep four hours straight.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoes that scare you a little?\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, my God.\nI'd die if I turned into a lousy lay, someone who gets fucked in her sleep.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you think that's what happens when people get married?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Does it?\nIs sex something you forget how to do? Or is it like riding a bike?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI think that depends on the...\non the couple.\nOf course, sex, uh...\ncan be...\na subterfuge, it can...\n\n**Patient:**\nDoctor.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOK.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK...\nSo anyway, I go to the kitchen to help out with something and when I come back Andrew and Gary are engrossed in this deep conversation about - you won't believe this - upholsterers.\nThere's this upholsterer who redid their living room and Andrew's taking the guy's number. I'm like, \"What are you doing?\" He said, \"You and I discussed recovering those armchairs your dad gave you.\" I'm telling you, we never discussed this and all of a sudden Andrew's reupholstering armchairs?\nI mean, we're talking metrosexual.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt doesn't sound like the Andrew you've been talking about.\n\n**Patient:**\nExactly! I mean, this was beyond metrosexual.\nDo you ever watch, uh, the Animal Planet?\nYeah, well, it was about this type of bird. I can't remember the name of it, but anyway, the male bird builds a nest for the female.\nYou know, these amazingly intricate structures.\nThey're incredible.\nAnyway, the female goes from nest to nest, you know, checking out all her various mating options, trying to make up her mind, while the male bird is desperately flapping about, trying to attract the female with his architecture.\nYou know, the nests look like cages.\nAnyway...\nthe whole way home I thought I wouldn't be able to fight this any more.\nSo when we got near the house, we were about to park and Andrew said to me, \"Do you want to go to the movies or stay home?\" I said...\nI said yes.\nAnd he says, \"Yes, the movies?\" And I said, \"Yes, home. I'll marry you.\n\"Yes.\" I mean, fuck it.\n\"Fuck, I'll marry you, yes.\" Mm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo where do you think this, um...\n\"Fuck it, yes,\" came from?\nI mean, everything that you've been saying to Andrew, everything you've been doing for the past few weeks has been one big no.\n\n**Patient:**\nI mean, what, you think Andrew took me there as some sort of object lesson?\nTo show me how good it could be for us? Cos I don't think so.\nAndrew's a pretty mediocre psychologist.\nWould you listen to me? I'm already bad-mouthing my future husband.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou didn't answer my question, Laura.\nWhere did this yes come from?\n\n**Patient:**\nYou really don't understand why I said yes to him?\nIt was because you said no to me.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause... Because I said no to you?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe whole situation is just one big fucking no.\nI'm not blaming you or accusing you, I'm just...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDid you expect a different reaction?\nIn your...\nfantasy...\nhow would I respond to you saying that you are, let's say, \"in love with me\"?\n\n**Patient:**\nFirst of all, take the quotation marks off the \"in love with me\".\nIt's insulting.\nAnd stop with the fantasy talk because fantasies are for silly little girls.\nWe're talking about reality, which is that I'm in love with you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBut I still...\n\n**Patient:**\nThat's reality.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI still want to talk about fantasies, for a minute.\nNot the fantasy of a silly little girl, but the fantasy of a grown, smart woman.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, please, let's not do that. That's beneath my dignity.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI don't think there's anything beneath our dignity if it takes us someplace our dignity refuses to go.\nYou remember that story you told me about that summer when you were 15 years old in San Diego?\nThat couple you lived with, the ones who had no children, David and Celia?\nYou said that summer was... was very significant to you.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, my God.\nMy mother just died, Doctor. Of course it was significant. Why rehash all this?\nMy mother died and I was very lucky to have somebody taking me in.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo?\nI want to go back to that period for a bit if you don't mind.\nYour mother was gone, your mother was your last wall of protection against your father... from your father's... How did you put it?\nUh...\n\n**Patient:**\nToxic fumes.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nToxic fumes, yes.\nHis Ioneliness, his fears, his dependency on you.\nYou said he'd call you in California and say how unhappy he was, how much he missed your mother and...\nbegging you to cut your vacation short and come home.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat's this got to do with anything?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou took a liking to these people who were athletic and healthy, the exact opposite of your parents in every way.\nAnd you described David very vividly.\nAnd you said he was very kind to you.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, you know, he used to take me camping, we'd go surfing.\nUsed to just talk about stuff, you know.\nTeenage bullshit.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou...\nYou were very attracted to him?\n\n**Patient:**\nHe was a hunk, yeah.\nHe looked like Nick Nolte.\nThey smoked a lot of grass, a lot of grass.\nI smoked with them. It was my first time.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd...\nwhen that summer was over...\nthey said it was a shame they couldn't adopt you.\n\n**Patient:**\nThey said, \"We want a daughter just like you.\" Yeah, I actually asked them to see if it was possible, if there was some legal way to...\nAnyway, they laughed at me, didn't take me seriously.\nThey said I was \"so cute\".\nActually, I wanted him to adopt me.\nShe was great, Celia, but, you know, I was 15.\nI wanted him all to myself.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMm.\nMakes a lot of sense when you think about it.\nYou were 15 years old, your father was grieving, completely dependent on you.\nDavid must've seemed like a life raft.\nJust as perhaps I am now.\nFrom Andrew.\nPerhaps I'm an alternative to everything Andrew represents - dependency, anxiety.\nBut I am not a realistic option for you, Laura.\nThis is a safe place where you can come.\nLike David with the beach.\n\n**Patient:**\nYes, but with one big difference.\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

I told you on the phone about the accident?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\n\n**Patient:**\nThey told me I need the opinion of a psychiatrist because the insurance company of the car that hit me has a problem with my injuries or...\nsomething like that. So that's why I'm here.\nI'm here for your professional opinion, not for...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNot for... Not for therapy?\nSo, let's see if I'm, uh... if I'm getting this right.\nAre you suing the insurance company of the person who hit you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Their insurance company had me talk to a social worker.\nAnd... she started asking me all sorts of annoying questions.\nShe was really annoying so I refused to talk to her.\nShe started talking to me like she knew me, so I refused to talk and that didn't go over so well, so my mother said it would be better if I came to talk to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nRight. So what happened at the accident that requires a psychiatric opinion?\n\n**Patient:**\nI really don't remember what happened.\nI was on my bicycle and a car ran into me and I don't remember what happened next.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat did they tell you afterwards?\n\n**Patient:**\nThat I flew my bike right into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're... You're laughing at that.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat that sounds like, flying straight into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you find that funny, yeah?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause it reminds me of something about two years ago.\nA... A friend of mine, he took me out on this motorbike and he stopped to get something at a convenience store.\nAnyway, I was really bored so I pretended that I knew how to drive it.\nYou put your hands on the handlebars and go like this.\nWell, it was one of those monster bikes.\nJust by turning the handle a little, it just flies.\nSo, suddenly, I'm like, zoom, and it takes off.\nMy head, it whips back like this and when I look down, I realise I'm riding into the street.\nTotally crashed into a car.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nThere was this old woman standing nearby and she saw all this. \"I saw her. She did it on purpose.\n\"She tried to kill herself. She tried to kill herself.\" That's what she was yelling?\nYeah, she was like a crazy woman.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\nCourse, it couldn't have been that funny when it happened, I'm sure?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Not really.\nI wanted to kill her. I was just lying there.\nI couldn't move. I couldn't do anything.\nI wanted to yell, \"Shut up, you... you idiot.\n\"Why are you screaming?\" You know? But I couldn't speak.\nIt's like this feeling...\nwhen somebody says something about you and you can't defend yourself.\nIt's totally unfair.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLike that social worker you were talking about.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat does she have to do with it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, didn't you feel that she was speaking for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, but I could have said something.\nI just didn't want to.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHm.\nSo, tell me a little more about this, uh, this accident.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's all in that report.\n\nWhere did it happen?\n\n**Patient:**\nIn a gas station on Madison near the gym where I train.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you were on the way to the gym?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. I told you I don't remember anything.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you feel comfortable talking about yourself, Sophie?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nMy name is Sophie. I'm 16 years old.\nI've been a gymnast since the age of six and a half.\nI was US junior champion at the age of 12.\nI'm an only child.\nI don't know. What do you wanna know?\nIn another few months are the national trials.\nLast chance to qualify for the Olympics.\nI'm kind of like... an Olympic hopeful.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWow.\nThat's really impressive. Congratulations.\n\n**Patient:**\nThank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo how is life in general?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, apart from the gymnastics.\nHow's life?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's great.\nI just don't have the energy for This Is Your Life right now.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThis Is Your Life? What do... What do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nYou know, like the TV show.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're way too young to know about that show.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's on DVD. My mom's friend watches it all the time.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you think of it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's OK.\nSome of the people on it are so old.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n Why do you think they put old people on that?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Cos they have nothing better to do?\nThey're retired and dying off fast so they put them on the show before it's too late.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo do you think you can help me with this professional opinion or not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's not that simple, Sophie.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause it's not like an X-ray where you can take photographs, look at the results and then you go on your way.\nIt doesn't quite work like that.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nOK, so I guess I'll leave.\nWould you at least like to read what it says in the report?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIf you want me to.\n\n**Patient:**\nLike you already know what it says?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. I've no idea what it says.\n\n**Patient:**\nListen, I didn't come here to talk about myself.\nI just need your opinion.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you want me to give you my opinion based on what I read and the conversation that we've had today, is that it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIs that a problem?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. No.\nI'll write up an opinion and, um...\nwhen you come next week, you can decide whether you want to use it or not.\n\n**Patient:**\nJust like that, without any more questions?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, what kind of questions do you want me to ask?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Shrink-like questions.\nSay, about Mom, Dad, that kind of thing?\nDoesn't sound like you're interested.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy would you say that, Sophie?\nI am very interested in everything that you have to say.\nI mean that.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou spoke to my mother already, didn't you?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI didn't.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou already know what it says in there.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI've never spoken to her.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou did and you're letting me sit here and you know exactly what's in that envelope.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWas I... Was I supposed to talk to her?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat, did you, like, plan everything?\nLike I'm some kind of idiot, you planned some charade?\nWhat's the point? Whatever. She would send me to someone like you.\nI should have listened to my father. He called them a cult of crazies.\nOpen the door for me, please.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd if I did speak to your mom?\n\n**Patient:**\nI knew it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, then?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt means you're a liar, OK?\nCos I know how it's supposed to work.\nYou're supposed to read that report and ask the stupid shrink questions you ask.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoesn't it seems unprofessional to so not do it that way?\nMaybe I have something to say about what it says in there.\nI just wanted to read the report by myself before our meeting next week. That's all.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat meeting next week?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'd like us to meet three or four times for me to form an opinion of you, to get to know you a little.\nDon't you think?\nOtherwise... it wouldn't be professional.\nHm?\nI'll read it now.\nOK?\nSo are all these ships instead of sailing for real?\n\n**Patient:**\nUh-huh.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAt least you won't get seasick.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh...\nI don't know about that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nSometimes I can get quite wobbly just sitting right here.\nYou have to make a round window to the outside.\nThen you'll feel like you're in a real ship.\nDid you really read all those books or is it just to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUh-huh.\n\n**Patient:**\nYes, you read them or yes, you're trying to make an impression?\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

It's an Islamic religious school.\nBoys like bees in a beehive studying the Koran.\n16 of them... dead.\nRings a bell?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes, I remember that, yes.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo, that's me.\nI flew that mission.\nThe Madrasah Murderer.\nSo, uh, do you surf the net?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, somehow... Well, it wasn't really somehow, it was...\n\n**Patient:**\nLet's call a spade a spade. A leak. Probably another intelligence fuck-up.\nAnyway, I was identified as the pilot in that mission and my photo was placed on fundamentalist websites.\nAnd I'm not talking Al Jazeera, I'm talking websites that are...\nasking for my head on a platter.\nOffering up the heavens and 40 virgins to anyone who will slit my throat from ear to ear.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHere, um...\n\n**Patient:**\nHere you are. It's not a recent photo. It's a photo taken when I was 18.\nOn a high-school trip to Europe, Holland.\nThat city with the miniatures. Ult... Utrecht.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUtrecht.\n\n**Patient:**\nRight.\nSo while I'm talking to you, a million fanatics are downloading my portrait and printing it out as a dartboard.\nSilly motherfuckers.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo, why have you come to see me?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhoa, whoa. We'll get to that.\nSo you're probably thinking, \"What's it like?\n\"He flew his mission, then he flew back \"and he saw the bodies of those children on CNN.\" You're probably trying to figure out what went through his head.\nLet me tell you, after that kind of mission, I don't watch CNN.\nI go to sleep.\nI'm dead tired.\nAnd you're probably dying to ask how I can sleep nights.\nOK, um...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow do you sleep?\n\n**Patient:**\nI sleep well, thank you very much, knowing it was mission accomplished and with great precision.\nI followed my orders, which were hit my target and hit it on time.\nTime and target. Do you know, we have to hit our targets within two seconds of the estimated time?\nIt's surgical. And that's one small window and I have never missed it.\nIf I had failed that task, I'd be in trouble with my superiors, with my conscience and with the system.\nBut I hit my target.\nSo, I sleep like a baby.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUm, h-how many...\nchildren...\ndied in this... in this mission?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe media puts it at 16.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd the air force?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe navy, Doctor, listen.\nThe navy says nothing and why should it?\nWe're not into body counts, we just hit targets.\nWe don't look back over our shoulder.\nWe do our thing so you can sit here in peace, talking to people for a living.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n So when did you hear that children had been killed?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe following afternoon. I heard it on the internet.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat exactly did you hear?\nAnything specifically that you remember?\n\n**Patient:**\nLike what? It's not like there's time in the day to be surfing the net, this was a moment, I got away.\nThere's a lot of stuff to keep me busy.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat kind of stuff?\n\n**Patient:**\nMission review, aerial photos, videos. Just data, stuff.\nPreparation versus execution.\nEvery tiny technical aspect of our flight is recorded and analysed by the man.\nThere's nowhere to hide. And that's the way it should be.\nIt's just stuff and more stuff.\nWhen my mother died, my father had a year's worth of stuff to deal with.\nLast will and testament, her office, garden, a lifetime of photo albums.\nAnd every time I talked to him, I'd ask how he was, expecting, uh...\nyou know, that... he'd break down.\nFinally.\n\"It never ends, Alex, it never ends. Your mother left such a mess.\n\"She didn't know she was gonna die.\" And that's all he said.\nAfter less than a year, he met another woman and got married, just like that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow did that make you feel?\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, surprised. A whole life together and not a single tear.\nMm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's interesting that you compare the death of your mother with this mission that you've just flown.\n\n**Patient:**\nThat's very clever of you.\nBut there's no relation whatsoever.\nMy mother's death was the most traumatic event in my life so far.\nThat mission was just another mission for Alex. There is no comparison.\nAnyway, look, that's over and I'm back now at my home base and now I'm on R&R.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat kind of things do you do for R&R?\n\n**Patient:**\nDon't try to get ahead of me.\nI'm a runner. I was a hell of a runner in high school and I'm still a good one for an old man. So, I run with my fairy friend.\nThis gay guy who could kick your ass at any sport.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd does he have a name, this friend?\n\n**Patient:**\nMm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDaniel.\n\n**Patient:**\nDaniel.\nWe've been running together for a long time, between six and ten miles.\nDepending on whether one of us is on his period. Only this time, I challenged him.\nIt was no good running in the Middle East, not for the US military, unless you want a bomb to blow your balls off!\nSo, I wanted to do some serious running. I said, \"Let's go for 15.\" After 15 miles, I said, \"20.\" He didn't want it.\nI said, \"OK, I'll go on my own.\" So, he followed.\nI said, \"You know, only six more and it's a marathon. Let's do it.\" He wanted to stop. Little bitch.\nBut I wasn't gonna stop.\nNo stop.\nWe were out of water, we were on fumes.\nAt 22 miles, I had a heart attack and died.\nA textbook case, straight out of med school.\nEnlargement of the left ventricle, in accordance with the family history on both sides, fatal.\nAccording to the EKG and according to statistics, I had a 97.3 per cent chance of dying.\nOr a 2.7 per cent chance of living. Anyway, dead.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou actually died?\n\n**Patient:**\nIn the clinical sense no pulse, no brain activity, total clinical death.\nBut here I am.\nNow I'm gonna disappoint you, Doctor.\nWanna know why I'm gonna disappoint you?\nLet me help you - the light, the tunnel, life flashing before my eyes.\nThat's what you're interested in, right?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, I wasn't actually thinking of that at all, but I am interested.\nTell me.\n\n**Patient:**\nI couldn't give a shit about it either.\nBut that's all everyone wanted to know about - my father, my wife.\nEveryone wanted to hear about the goddamn tunnel.\nJust such bullshit.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you feel that maybe you disappointed people by not having that experience?\nThat maybe in some way you failed to deliver the goods?\n\n**Patient:**\nNobody really knows what was going through my mind during those last few moments.\nAs soon as there was no more tunnel, no one was interested.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd what was going through your mind?\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, I knew what was happening, you can tell.\nAnd you're afraid it's the end.\nIn all that time until I lost consciousness...\nAll that time... I don't know, it was maybe seconds, maybe half a minute.\nAll that time I kept trying to figure out if I had a hard-on.\nI don't know how I remembered, it was something my grandmother told me, when I was in high school, and she said when Grandpa died, she found him lying naked in the bathtub with a huge erection.\nNow, he's... he was 92 years old.\nShe hadn't seen an erection like that in 20 years.\nShe liked it. She said that was God's final gift to a man.\nA dead man's boner. They call it angel lust.\nAnyway, I'm lying there thinking about that story.\nI know what's happening and I said to myself, \"God Almighty, just don't let me have an erection now, not a hard-on.\" Because if you had an erection, it would mean...\nThat would mean that I was dead.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd your friend Daniel was with you throughout this?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, resuscitation, CPR... Daniel's a doctor. I forgot to say that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh. For a minute I thought you were going to say something else, that perhaps your fear of an erection was associated with the presence of your friend, Daniel.\n\n**Patient:**\nExcuse me?\nYou're exaggerating. I explained something simple, a dead man's erection - what's that got to do with Daniel?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, maybe I didn't make myself clear earlier on when I was talking about the customer always being wrong.\nWhat I meant was that sometimes the patient hides things from his therapist, from himself.\nAnd so part of our job is to uncover the things that we hide.\n\n**Patient:**\n So, my secret is I'm afraid of homosexuals?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, not necessarily. But I just wanted to clarify that.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, that's neither here nor there. I want to get to my point.\nI didn't have the erection, so relax.\nBut I remember very vividly that moment just before passing out, before losing consciousness.\nLosing consciousness, that's a funny expression.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy do you think that's a funny expression?\n\n**Patient:**\nLosing consciousness - it's an expression my father would use.\nEverything in terms of profits and loss.\nFits him like a glove.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo something about how you describe your last moments is equated with your father's seeing things in terms of profit and loss?\n\n**Patient:**\nOK, OK, with all due respect, I think we've come to this way too early.\nThe father-son relationship stuff shouldn't come up so soon.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou think it's too soon?\n\n**Patient:**\nForget what I feel.\nI know it's too soon. I wanna know what you think.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you're... You're testing me?\n\n**Patient:**\nI'm entitled to some testing. I'm paying.\nActually, I think you've been testing me since you walked in.\nYou've asked about me and my reputation, you ask, you practically demand that I ask certain questions that you think I am dying to ask.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's important to you, I think, that I adhere to certain standards you set before you walked through the door.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat's wrong with that? Look, I did my research.\nIt's a 1  1/2 hour drive to get here and I'm paying you good money.\nAnd I'm expected to tell you, a perfect stranger, the most intimate things about my life.\nPlus there are risks here.\nIt's not like the navy's gonna give me a medal for spilling my guts, I'm not gonna open up to you without knowing what you are.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd what do you expect to find, Alex?\nHow are we going to know that I'm a good enough therapist for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nI'll know...\naccording to your opinion.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMy opinion of what?\n\n**Patient:**\nOf the issue I came to talk about.\nBut I'll come to that in a minute.\nIt's to do with what happened after taking me out of the freezer.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe freezer?\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, you mean that you were grounded?\nNo, literally frozen. They froze me.\nThe mobile intensive care unit arrived and put me in a suit that freezes you.\nThey got one no more than three-quarters of a mile from where I collapsed.\nAnd their ER is tops.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLet's go back to this...\n\n**Patient:**\nWe're getting there. You have no patience.\nI was told you're a good listener.\nNow look, it works on a very simple principle.\nIt reduces the shock to the body's systems by dropping the body temperature.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo how long were you...\n\n**Patient:**\nIn my case, 48 hours. It's a record.\nThere's no history of anyone who's been in that suit for such a long time.\nI guess I went a long way up that tunnel.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThe tunnel that wasn't there?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, unfortunately not.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo tell me what you remember about this 48 hours.\n\n**Patient:**\nMostly I remember, um... a terrible fatigue.\nI guess that's why they call it \"dead tired\".\nIt's physical, but mainly mental exhaustion.\nAnd I remember very clearly the relief I felt when I succeeded in coming back over into the \nworld.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou say that you succeeded in coming back to this world.\nDid... Did you feel it was under your control?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat are you trying to get at?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'm not trying to get at anything.\nBut what you're describing is a strong will to live.\n\n**Patient:**\nDuring this experience, there was a decision to go on living.\nYeah, I guess you're right.\nDespite having made this effort to live...\neverybody's disappointed.\nIt's not every day people meet someone who's come back from the dead.\nIt's a one-in-a-million thing. And if you don't supply the goods, then...\nListen, I have never spent a day in my life in a hospital.\nYou get it? Never.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo, perhaps your anger isn't directed at those people interested in the tunnel.\nPerhaps you're angry at yourself, Alex. How your body betrayed you.\nThis is a systems failure that was not supposed to happen to somebody like you.\n\n**Patient:**\nHmh.\nI have a brother, who's not bright, he's a real-estate agent.\nAnyway, he's a great athlete. And he once proved to me, and he does his research, believe me...\nthat all the great quarterbacks in the history of football were also the best looking.\nNamath, Staubach, Cunningham, they're all good-Iooking people.\nThe best-Iooking students in the class are often great athletes.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou know why that is?\n\n**Patient:**\nI've no idea.\nIt's got nothing to do with sports.\nWhen they got their gift from God the Father, or whoever the hell doles out the talent, they got the whole package - beauty, talent, character.\nThat's how it is. It's an evolutionary thing.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo, how is your football?\n\n**Patient:**\nNah.\nFootball's not my game. Running, of course.\nWrestling. Pole vault, once upon a time.\nBut now, I am part of a military elite.\nAthletes may be popular, but we are the creme de la creme.\nYou have to understand, this is a person whose whole life was perfect.\nPeople in my line of work are born to excel, to be perfect.\nIt wasn't our choice, it was life that chose us to be the best.\nAnd what does that mean? \"Life chose us?\" Yeah, you don't become a fighter pilot suddenly at age 20.\nAt age seven or eight, when you're in the third grade, you know you're talented.\nYou know you're headed somewhere special, you are going to be the best and it all lays out right in front of you.\nTop grades, varsity letters, you name it.\nI'm a TOPGUN grad, you understand that? That training is not for pussies.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo if you don't achieve your personal best,\nare you disappointed in yourself?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, no, that's not...\nHow much longer do we have?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWe've got time. I'II...\nI'll tell you when it's... when it's time.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK, so here's my point, finally.\nI came to get your advice on something.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSure.\n\n**Patient:**\nI decided to go there. To the target.\nYou understand what I'm talking about here?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou mean to the site where you dropped the bomb, to the school?\n\n**Patient:**\nMadrasah. I wanna go back, take a look around.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhere the children were killed?\n\n**Patient:**\nI know what you're thinking, so let me straighten this out.\nI don't have a guilty conscience, I already told you that. I sleep very well.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBut why would you want to go back?\n\n**Patient:**\nI'm interested.\nFrom the moment I came out of that freezer, I knew I wanted to go back.\nIt came up in a conversation I had with Daniel when he visited me at the hospital.\nHe thinks I'm gonna freak out or something, he thinks it's a crazy thing to do.\nAnd he said I need to see someone first - psychologist, psychiatrist.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDon't you think it's dangerous?\n\n**Patient:**\nNot at all.\nI don't think anyone would recognise me.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBut your picture's on the internet.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo way. You saw the picture.\nIt's ridiculous. My mother wouldn't recognise me, not even Michaela.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWho's Michaela?\n\n**Patient:**\nMy wife.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat does she think of all this?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat's she got to do with it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDon't you talk with your wife?\n\n**Patient:**\nThis is not for me, all this \"What do you feel? What do you think?\" I asked you something, I came to you to consult about something specific.\nSo, you want me to tell you that this desire of yours to go back to where the bombing took place is a good thing?\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy. You are feeling neutral.\nNow, you will make the patient feel at ease. Continue your dialogue and tell them how much you look forward to this session.\nTwo sentences maximum.

He had this thing with this on-and-off...\nOK, so I said yes.\nTo Andrew.\nWe set a date. It's gonna be the third weekend in June.\nEverybody gets married in June.\nSo...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you'll be a summer bride.\n\n**Patient:**\nEvidently so.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, congratulations.\n\n**Patient:**\nThank you.\nSo, are you happy for us?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs that important to you?\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, if you're gonna be a guest at our wedding, you'd better be happy for us.\nAndrew and I wanted to invite you. Your wife too.\nBut you wouldn't come, would you? Of course you wouldn't.\nBut we did actually talk about it yesterday, right after I said yes, we started making a guest list and for a few minutes you were on it.\nWait a minute, you said yes just yesterday?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYeah.\nI couldn't make up my mind.\nIt took me a few days to get over the other night and our session.\nI, uh... I wanted to calm down first.\n\n**Patient:**\nAndrew was cool, he said a day here or there wouldn't matter as long as I was moving towards a decision.\nYou know, he's very happy that you're helping me.\nFor a while there, he thought he'd made a mistake recommending that I come see you.\nHe thinks you're an amazing therapist and that his instincts were just right, and that you're on our side.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat?\nUh... I guess I'm just trying to get used to...\nto the change in tone.\nYou're speaking in the plural.\n\n**Patient:**\nWell, I'm gonna be a \"we\", an \"us\", aren't I?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou say that like you're not so sure.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, I'm sure.\nYou know, Doctor, I'm generally open to your interpretations, but it just seems like you're being a bit of a...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nKilljoy?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, something like that. So don't.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nJoy is a very rare thing when it comes to me.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'm...\nI'm just wondering if you came here today determined to, uh...\ndemonstrate that joy, especially after last week's events.\nI'm asking myself if this isn't a bit too fast, if you haven't perhaps taken a short cut.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou think that I'm faking this? That I'm actually totally depressed?\nWell, maybe it's you that's faking it, huh?\nI mean, that congratulations was a bit laboured, don't you think?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI...\nI don't know if you know anything about, um, scuba diving.\nThey have this thing that's called the bends.\nIt's something that happens when the divers come up to the surface too quickly.\nIt's really dangerous.\nIt can explode your lungs from the sudden changes in pressure.\nAnyway, it...\nit seems like there's... there's a huge gap between...\nthe depths that you reached last week and the heights...\nat which you are today. I'm just trying to...\nI'm just trying to adjust myself so that I don't, uh...\nI guess, come to the surface too quickly.\n\n**Patient:**\nDo you dive, Doctor?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nI... Well, w-we used to.\n\n**Patient:**\nOoh, who's speaking in the plural now?\nI can't imagine you diving.\nWhere'd you go? Mexico? The Caribbean?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAre you interested in...\nscuba diving?\n\n**Patient:**\nI'm a certified diver.\nI know what the bends are.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSorry.\n\n**Patient:**\nNo, seriously, I dove a lot before I met Andrew.\nHe hates it and he's claustrophobic.\nIt's nice to find we have something in common, you and me, isn't it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhere are you now, Laura?\n\n**Patient:**\nI just had a scary thought. I just, um...\nI know it's silly but...\nbeforehand when you said your...\nyour lungs could explode, it was just the thought that something might happen to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYet you're the one who ascended so fast.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou know what, Doctor? I don't want a depressing session.\nI want a happy session. I came with good news, so show a little support.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOK.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK, yesterday, um, I was at Natalie's, you know, Andrew's ex, and Gary, the husband. The ones who had a baby a few months ago.\nThey keep inviting us over and I keep avoiding them but yesterday they invited us for brunch...\nAnyway, Gary makes dim sum. He has those bamboo steamers and everything.\nSo I said to Andrew, \"OK, let's go.\" He's been so sweet all week, I thought it was the least I could do.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo his agreeing to postpone the ultimatum, that...\ndisarmed you?\nAll right. Go ahead.\n\n**Patient:**\nThey have a baby. These huge eyes.\nThe baby is all eyes, so beautiful.\nAnd the way he breast-feeds, all morning he was attached to Natalie's nipple, this huge dark nipple - I've never seen anything like it.\nAt one point she took her boob out of the baby's mouth and squeezed it and some milk squirted out.\nAnd Andrew has this admiring smile on his face, you know, like he was looking at some masterpiece in a museum, like the Madonna.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you think he saw?\nMaybe an image of you and he together in the future, maybe?\n\n**Patient:**\nOr maybe he just misses her tits.\nNo, not really. They're not that nice.\nShe's changed since she had the baby.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIn what way?\n\n**Patient:**\nI didn't really know her before but Andrew told me a lot about her.\nHe said she was this wild type, you know, who had a lot of guys chasing her.\nShe put him through hell. He said they'd go to bed and she'd be one person, they'd wake up and she'd be someone totally new.\nA free radical, that's what he used to call her.\nHe says I remind him of her.\nThat's scary. Like this is what's left of her, her T-shirt's soaking wet and nipples - nipples, that's all that's left.\nShe's like a wild animal that's somehow been...\nShit, what's the word?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDomesticated?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, she looked domesticated, house-broken.\nShe said her wildest sexual fantasy was to sleep four hours straight.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoes that scare you a little?\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, my God.\nI'd die if I turned into a lousy lay, someone who gets fucked in her sleep.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you think that's what happens when people get married?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Does it?\nIs sex something you forget how to do? Or is it like riding a bike?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI think that depends on the...\non the couple.\nOf course, sex, uh...\ncan be...\na subterfuge, it can...\n\n**Patient:**\nDoctor.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOK.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK...\nSo anyway, I go to the kitchen to help out with something and when I come back Andrew and Gary are engrossed in this deep conversation about - you won't believe this - upholsterers.\nThere's this upholsterer who redid their living room and Andrew's taking the guy's number. I'm like, \"What are you doing?\" He said, \"You and I discussed recovering those armchairs your dad gave you.\" I'm telling you, we never discussed this and all of a sudden Andrew's reupholstering armchairs?\nI mean, we're talking metrosexual.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt doesn't sound like the Andrew you've been talking about.\n\n**Patient:**\nExactly! I mean, this was beyond metrosexual.\nDo you ever watch, uh, the Animal Planet?\nYeah, well, it was about this type of bird. I can't remember the name of it, but anyway, the male bird builds a nest for the female.\nYou know, these amazingly intricate structures.\nThey're incredible.\nAnyway, the female goes from nest to nest, you know, checking out all her various mating options, trying to make up her mind, while the male bird is desperately flapping about, trying to attract the female with his architecture.\nYou know, the nests look like cages.\nAnyway...\nthe whole way home I thought I wouldn't be able to fight this any more.\nSo when we got near the house, we were about to park and Andrew said to me, \"Do you want to go to the movies or stay home?\" I said...\nI said yes.\nAnd he says, \"Yes, the movies?\" And I said, \"Yes, home. I'll marry you.\n\"Yes.\" I mean, fuck it.\n\"Fuck, I'll marry you, yes.\" Mm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo where do you think this, um...\n\"Fuck it, yes,\" came from?\nI mean, everything that you've been saying to Andrew, everything you've been doing for the past few weeks has been one big no.\n\n**Patient:**\nI mean, what, you think Andrew took me there as some sort of object lesson?\nTo show me how good it could be for us? Cos I don't think so.\nAndrew's a pretty mediocre psychologist.\nWould you listen to me? I'm already bad-mouthing my future husband.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou didn't answer my question, Laura.\nWhere did this yes come from?\n\n**Patient:**\nYou really don't understand why I said yes to him?\nIt was because you said no to me.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause... Because I said no to you?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe whole situation is just one big fucking no.\nI'm not blaming you or accusing you, I'm just...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDid you expect a different reaction?\nIn your...\nfantasy...\nhow would I respond to you saying that you are, let's say, \"in love with me\"?\n\n**Patient:**\nFirst of all, take the quotation marks off the \"in love with me\".\nIt's insulting.\nAnd stop with the fantasy talk because fantasies are for silly little girls.\nWe're talking about reality, which is that I'm in love with you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBut I still...\n\n**Patient:**\nThat's reality.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI still want to talk about fantasies, for a minute.\nNot the fantasy of a silly little girl, but the fantasy of a grown, smart woman.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, please, let's not do that. That's beneath my dignity.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI don't think there's anything beneath our dignity if it takes us someplace our dignity refuses to go.\nYou remember that story you told me about that summer when you were 15 years old in San Diego?\nThat couple you lived with, the ones who had no children, David and Celia?\nYou said that summer was... was very significant to you.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, my God.\nMy mother just died, Doctor. Of course it was significant. Why rehash all this?\nMy mother died and I was very lucky to have somebody taking me in.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo?\nI want to go back to that period for a bit if you don't mind.\nYour mother was gone, your mother was your last wall of protection against your father... from your father's... How did you put it?\nUh...\n\n**Patient:**\nToxic fumes.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nToxic fumes, yes.\nHis Ioneliness, his fears, his dependency on you.\nYou said he'd call you in California and say how unhappy he was, how much he missed your mother and...\nbegging you to cut your vacation short and come home.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat's this got to do with anything?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou took a liking to these people who were athletic and healthy, the exact opposite of your parents in every way.\nAnd you described David very vividly.\nAnd you said he was very kind to you.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, you know, he used to take me camping, we'd go surfing.\nUsed to just talk about stuff, you know.\nTeenage bullshit.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou...\nYou were very attracted to him?\n\n**Patient:**\nHe was a hunk, yeah.\nHe looked like Nick Nolte.\nThey smoked a lot of grass, a lot of grass.\nI smoked with them. It was my first time.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd...\nwhen that summer was over...\nthey said it was a shame they couldn't adopt you.\n\n**Patient:**\nThey said, \"We want a daughter just like you.\" Yeah, I actually asked them to see if it was possible, if there was some legal way to...\nAnyway, they laughed at me, didn't take me seriously.\nThey said I was \"so cute\".\nActually, I wanted him to adopt me.\nShe was great, Celia, but, you know, I was 15.\nI wanted him all to myself.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMm.\nMakes a lot of sense when you think about it.\nYou were 15 years old, your father was grieving, completely dependent on you.\nDavid must've seemed like a life raft.\nJust as perhaps I am now.\nFrom Andrew.\nPerhaps I'm an alternative to everything Andrew represents - dependency, anxiety.\nBut I am not a realistic option for you, Laura.\nThis is a safe place where you can come.\nLike David with the beach.\n\n**Patient:**\nYes, but with one big difference.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat's that?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't want you to adopt me, I want you to fuck me.\nI need to pee.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUh, there's, um... there's... there's a problem with the, um...\nwith the thing, it's...\nIt's blocked up.\nI'm gonna call the handyman.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK, well, then, may I?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUh, well...\nWe're almost out of time, so...\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat, are we camping? I need to pee. What's the big deal?\nI won't mess your bathroom.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI prefer my patients to use the...\n\n**Patient:**\nBut you just said that the toilet overflowed.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy don't we just finish up for today?\nI can owe you the ten minutes when you come back next week.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat, you're afraid your wife will see me?\nOr that I'll see her?\nIs she even home now?\nIs she sitting with rollers in her hair drinking beer?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThis is nothing to do with my wife.\n\n**Patient:**\nForget it, if it freaks you out that much.\nWell, I bet that didn't come up in med school, did it?\nHm?\nWhat to do in the following situation.\nA patient, in love with her therapist, asks to use the bathroom.\nThe bathroom is out of order.\nThe patient then asks to enter the therapist's home.\nWhat should the therapist do?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'm sorry if...\n\n**Patient:**\nThe correct answer is it depends on what the therapist feels towards his patient.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI can see that you might interpret...\n\n**Patient:**\nDon't interpret, Doctor.\nI've had it up to here with your fucking interpretations.\nYou know what kills me? That no matter what I say or do, you see everything as more proof that nothing is going on here.\nYou turn me into a 15-year-old who isn't taken seriously.\nA silly girl who people pat on the head and say, \"Isn't she cute?\"\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou know, the... I...\n\n**Patient:**\nStop patronising me, Doctor.\nLook, I know when I turn somebody on, OK?\nYou know what I thought of you the first time I saw you?\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

He said they'd go to bed and she'd be one person, they'd wake up and she'd be someone totally new.\nA free radical, that's what he used to call her.\nHe says I remind him of her.\nThat's scary. Like this is what's left of her, her T-shirt's soaking wet and nipples - nipples, that's all that's left.\nShe's like a wild animal that's somehow been...\nShit, what's the word?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDomesticated?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, she looked domesticated, house-broken.\nShe said her wildest sexual fantasy was to sleep four hours straight.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoes that scare you a little?\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, my God.\nI'd die if I turned into a lousy lay, someone who gets fucked in her sleep.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you think that's what happens when people get married?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Does it?\nIs sex something you forget how to do?

I'm like, \"What are you doing?\" He said, \"You and I discussed recovering those armchairs your dad gave you.\" I'm telling you, we never discussed this and all of a sudden Andrew's reupholstering armchairs?\nI mean, we're talking metrosexual.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt doesn't sound like the Andrew you've been talking about.\n\n**Patient:**\nExactly! I mean, this was beyond metrosexual.\nDo you ever watch, uh, the Animal Planet?\nYeah, well, it was about this type of bird. I can't remember the name of it, but anyway, the male bird builds a nest for the female.\nYou know, these amazingly intricate structures.\nThey're incredible.\nAnyway, the female goes from nest to nest, you know, checking out all her various mating options, trying to make up her mind, while the male bird is desperately flapping about, trying to attract the female with his architecture.\nYou know, the nests look like cages.\nAnyway...\nthe whole way home I thought I wouldn't be able to fight this any more.\nSo when we got near the house, we were about to park and Andrew said to me, \"Do you want to go to the movies or stay home?\" I said...\nI said yes.\nAnd he says, \"Yes, the movies?\" And I said, \"Yes, home. I'll marry you.\n\"Yes.\" I mean, fuck it.\n\"Fuck, I'll marry you, yes.\" Mm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo where do you think this, um...\n\"Fuck it, yes,\" came from?\nI mean, everything that you've been saying to Andrew, everything you've been doing for the past few weeks has been one big no.\n\n**Patient:**\nI mean, what, you think Andrew took me there as some sort of object lesson?\nTo show me how good it could be for us? Cos I don't think so.\nAndrew's a pretty mediocre psychologist.\nWould you listen to me? I'm already bad-mouthing my future husband.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou didn't answer my question, Laura.\nWhere did this yes come from?\n\n**Patient:**\nYou really don't understand why I said yes to him?\nIt was because you said no to me.\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

I'm a customer.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYeah.\nThough in my profession, we say that the customer is always wrong.\nIt's a... It's a therapist's joke.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo, do you recognise me?\nNo.\nI'm sorry, uh, should I?\nI was told you were the best, a man in tune with everything around him,\nso you should.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThank you.\nBut I do think that in this profession, \"the best\" is really a matter of personal opinion.\nNo, the best can be established by facts and figures.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou're the best. I did my research.\nCouple of former patients, someone who knew you from graduate school.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoes that pressure you?\nIs it important for you to know\nthat I am the best?\n\n**Patient:**\nYes.\nIt's nothing personal, I always go to the best - dentists, mechanics.\nYou know what they say - save now, pay later.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what do you think being the best therapist entails?\n\n**Patient:**\nDo you recognise me?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, I...\nI... I don't.\n\n**Patient:**\nLet me help.\nThe Madrasah Murderer.\nDoes that mean anything to you?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt wasn't that long ago.\nUS Navy aircraft hit a target on the outskirts of Baghdad.\nNaval Intelligence identified the structure as an insurgents' safe house, a bunker. Turns out it's a madrasah.\nLet me tell you what that is. It's an Islamic religious school.\nBoys like bees in a beehive studying the Koran.\n16 of them... dead.\nRings a bell?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes, I remember that, yes.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo, that's me.\nI flew that mission.\nThe Madrasah Murderer.\nSo, uh, do you surf the net?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, somehow... Well, it wasn't really somehow, it was...\n\n**Patient:**\nLet's call a spade a spade. A leak. Probably another intelligence fuck-up.\nAnyway, I was identified as the pilot in that mission and my photo was placed on fundamentalist websites.\nAnd I'm not talking Al Jazeera, I'm talking websites that are...\nasking for my head on a platter.\nOffering up the heavens and 40 virgins to anyone who will slit my throat from ear to ear.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHere, um...\n\n**Patient:**\nHere you are. It's not a recent photo. It's a photo taken when I was 18.\nOn a high-school trip to Europe, Holland.\nThat city with the miniatures. Ult... Utrecht.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUtrecht.\n\n**Patient:**\nRight.\nSo while I'm talking to you, a million fanatics are downloading my portrait and printing it out as a dartboard.\nSilly motherfuckers.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo, why have you come to see me?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhoa, whoa. We'll get to that.\nSo you're probably thinking, \"What's it like?\n\"He flew his mission, then he flew back \"and he saw the bodies of those children on CNN.\" You're probably trying to figure out what went through his head.\nLet me tell you, after that kind of mission, I don't watch CNN.\nI go to sleep.\nI'm dead tired.\nAnd you're probably dying to ask how I can sleep nights.\nOK, um...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHow do you sleep?\n\n**Patient:**\nI sleep well, thank you very much, knowing it was mission accomplished and with great precision.\nI followed my orders, which were hit my target and hit it on time.\nTime and target. Do you know, we have to hit our targets within two seconds of the estimated time?\nIt's surgical. And that's one small window and I have never missed it.\nIf I had failed that task, I'd be in trouble with my superiors, with my conscience and with the system.\nBut I hit my target.\nSo, I sleep like a baby.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUm, h-how many...\nchildren...\ndied in this... in this mission?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe media puts it at 16.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd the air force?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe navy, Doctor, listen.\nThe navy says nothing and why should it?\nWe're not into body counts, we just hit targets.\nWe don't look back over our shoulder.\nWe do our thing so you can sit here in peace, talking to people for a living.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n So when did you hear that children had been killed?\n\n**Patient:**\nThe following afternoon. I heard it on the internet.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat exactly did you hear?\nAnything specifically that you remember?\n\n**Patient:**\nLike what? It's not like there's time in the day to be surfing the net, this was a moment, I got away.\nThere's a lot of stuff to keep me busy.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat kind of stuff?\n\n**Patient:**\nMission review, aerial photos, videos. Just data, stuff.\nPreparation versus execution.\nEvery tiny technical aspect of our flight is recorded and analysed by the man.\nThere's nowhere to hide. And that's the way it should be.\nIt's just stuff and more stuff.\nWhen my mother died, my father had a year's worth of stuff to deal with.\nLast will and testament, her office, garden, a lifetime of photo albums.\nAnd every time I talked to him, I'd ask how he was, expecting, uh...\nyou know, that... he'd break down.\nFinally.\n\"It never ends, Alex, it never ends. Your mother left such a mess.\n\"She didn't know she was gonna die.\" And that's all he said.\nAfter less than a year, he met another woman and got married, just like that.\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

She heard about you from a friend of yours.\nI mean, a friend of hers, not a friend of yours.\nFrom a patient of yours who is a friend of hers. Sorry.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMm. So, Anna Colden recommended you through a patient.\n\n**Patient:**\nDo you know his name?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI don't know.\nSo what did Anna recommend me for?\n\n**Patient:**\nAfter my accident... I told you on the phone about the accident?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\n\n**Patient:**\nThey told me I need the opinion of a psychiatrist because the insurance company of the car that hit me has a problem with my injuries or...\nsomething like that. So that's why I'm here.\nI'm here for your professional opinion, not for...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNot for... Not for therapy?\nSo, let's see if I'm, uh... if I'm getting this right.\nAre you suing the insurance company of the person who hit you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Their insurance company had me talk to a social worker.\nAnd... she started asking me all sorts of annoying questions.\nShe was really annoying so I refused to talk to her.\nShe started talking to me like she knew me, so I refused to talk and that didn't go over so well, so my mother said it would be better if I came to talk to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nRight. So what happened at the accident that requires a psychiatric opinion?\n\n**Patient:**\nI really don't remember what happened.\nI was on my bicycle and a car ran into me and I don't remember what happened next.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat did they tell you afterwards?\n\n**Patient:**\nThat I flew my bike right into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're... You're laughing at that.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat that sounds like, flying straight into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you find that funny, yeah?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause it reminds me of something about two years ago.\nA... A friend of mine, he took me out on this motorbike and he stopped to get something at a convenience store.\nAnyway, I was really bored so I pretended that I knew how to drive it.\nYou put your hands on the handlebars and go like this.\nWell, it was one of those monster bikes.\nJust by turning the handle a little, it just flies.\nSo, suddenly, I'm like, zoom, and it takes off.\nMy head, it whips back like this and when I look down, I realise I'm riding into the street.\nTotally crashed into a car.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nThere was this old woman standing nearby and she saw all this. \"I saw her. She did it on purpose.\n\"She tried to kill herself. She tried to kill herself.\" That's what she was yelling?\nYeah, she was like a crazy woman.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\nCourse, it couldn't have been that funny when it happened, I'm sure?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Not really.\nI wanted to kill her. I was just lying there.\nI couldn't move. I couldn't do anything.\nI wanted to yell, \"Shut up, you... you idiot.\n\"Why are you screaming?\" You know? But I couldn't speak.\nIt's like this feeling...\nwhen somebody says something about you and you can't defend yourself.\nIt's totally unfair.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLike that social worker you were talking about.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat does she have to do with it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, didn't you feel that she was speaking for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, but I could have said something.\nI just didn't want to.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHm.\nSo, tell me a little more about this, uh, this accident.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's all in that report.\n\nWhere did it happen?\n\n**Patient:**\nIn a gas station on Madison near the gym where I train.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you were on the way to the gym?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. I told you I don't remember anything.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you feel comfortable talking about yourself, Sophie?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nMy name is Sophie. I'm 16 years old.\nI've been a gymnast since the age of six and a half.\nI was US junior champion at the age of 12.\nI'm an only child.\nI don't know.

What do... What do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nYou know, like the TV show.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're way too young to know about that show.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's on DVD.

Cos they have nothing better to do?\nThey're retired and dying off fast so they put them on the show before it's too late.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo do you think you can help me with this professional opinion or not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's not that simple, Sophie.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause it's not like an X-ray where you can take photographs, look at the results and then you go on your way.\nIt doesn't quite work like that.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nOK, so I guess I'll leave.\nWould you at least like to read what it says in the report?\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

My mom's friend watches it all the time.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you think of it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's OK.\nSome of the people on it are so old.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n Why do you think they put old people on that?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Cos they have nothing better to do?\nThey're retired and dying off fast so they put them on the show before it's too late.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo do you think you can help me with this professional opinion or not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's not that simple, Sophie.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause it's not like an X-ray where you can take photographs, look at the results and then you go on your way.\nIt doesn't quite work like that.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nOK, so I guess I'll leave.\nWould you at least like to read what it says in the report?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIf you want me to.\n\n**Patient:**\nLike you already know what it says?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. I've no idea what it says.\n\n**Patient:**\nListen, I didn't come here to talk about myself.\nI just need your opinion.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you want me to give you my opinion based on what I read and the conversation that we've had today, is that it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIs that a problem?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. No.\nI'll write up an opinion and, um...\nwhen you come next week, you can decide whether you want to use it or not.\n\n**Patient:**\nJust like that, without any more questions?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, what kind of questions do you want me to ask?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Shrink-like questions.\nSay, about Mom, Dad, that kind of thing?\nDoesn't sound like you're interested.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy would you say that, Sophie?\nI am very interested in everything that you have to say.\nI mean that.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou spoke to my mother already, didn't you?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI didn't.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou already know what it says in there.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI've never spoken to her.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou did and you're letting me sit here and you know exactly what's in that envelope.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWas I... Was I supposed to talk to her?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat, did you, like, plan everything?\nLike I'm some kind of idiot, you planned some charade?\nWhat's the point? Whatever. She would send me to someone like you.\nI should have listened to my father. He called them a cult of crazies.\nOpen the door for me, please.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd if I did speak to your mom?\n\n**Patient:**\nI knew it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, then?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt means you're a liar, OK?\nCos I know how it's supposed to work.\nYou're supposed to read that report and ask the stupid shrink questions you ask.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoesn't it seems unprofessional to so not do it that way?\nMaybe I have something to say about what it says in there.\nI just wanted to read the report by myself before our meeting next week. That's all.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat meeting next week?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'd like us to meet three or four times for me to form an opinion of you, to get to know you a little.\nDon't you think?\nOtherwise... it wouldn't be professional.\nHm?\nI'll read it now.\nOK?\nSo are all these ships instead of sailing for real?\n\n**Patient:**\nUh-huh.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAt least you won't get seasick.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh...\nI don't know about that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nSometimes I can get quite wobbly just sitting right here.\nYou have to make a round window to the outside.\nThen you'll feel like you're in a real ship.\nDid you really read all those books or is it just to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUh-huh.\n\n**Patient:**\nYes, you read them or yes, you're trying to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nI've read them.\nI feel sorry for the books up there.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh. Why do you feel sorry for them?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhere would you put them?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. They're your fucking books.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou suffer from asthma.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. How do you know that?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThere's an inhaler here.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, thanks. I've been looking everywhere for that. Thank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, you could have died without it?\nAccording to what it says here...\nit looks like you could have died too.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. That would have solved a lot of problems.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat would it solve?\n\n**Patient:**\nNothing. I didn't mean anything by it.\nCan I talk to you like a normal person?\nDo you drive your daughter crazy with questions like this too?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMuch more crazy, believe me.\nHow d'you know I had a daughter?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause you do.\nYou know my mother.\nYou were on the PTA committee at Arlington elementary.\nI was there before I went off to a private school.\nI was in the same year as your daughter.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, why didn't you tell me that before?\n\n**Patient:**\nHm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou said that the, uh... that the social worker spoke to you like she knew you.\n\n**Patient:**\nShe was such a retard.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDid she ask you if, um... if you think about death a lot?\n\n**Patient:**\nHow did you know that?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAccording to what it says here, she was trying to prove that the accident was your fault.\nIt's a good thing you didn't answer any of her questions.\nBy the way, everybody thinks about death.\nI bet she didn't say that, though.\nDid she ask you if you had any specific thoughts about death?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you?\n\n**Patient:**\nDo I what?\nEveryone... Everyone thinks about death and, uh...\nimagines how it will come to them.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you have any more specific thoughts about it?\nI mean, maybe you have certain thoughts that you'd like to talk about.\n\n**Patient:**\nUnless you're worried about what I...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'm not worried.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nIs this how it's going to be for three appointments?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs this a little difficult for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nCan I have some water?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSure.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh.\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy.

So, Anna Colden recommended you through a patient.\n\n**Patient:**\nDo you know his name?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI don't know.\nSo what did Anna recommend me for?\n\n**Patient:**\nAfter my accident... I told you on the phone about the accident?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\n\n**Patient:**\nThey told me I need the opinion of a psychiatrist because the insurance company of the car that hit me has a problem with my injuries or...\nsomething like that. So that's why I'm here.\nI'm here for your professional opinion, not for...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNot for... Not for therapy?\nSo, let's see if I'm, uh... if I'm getting this right.\nAre you suing the insurance company of the person who hit you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Their insurance company had me talk to a social worker.\nAnd... she started asking me all sorts of annoying questions.\nShe was really annoying so I refused to talk to her.\nShe started talking to me like she knew me, so I refused to talk and that didn't go over so well, so my mother said it would be better if I came to talk to you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nRight. So what happened at the accident that requires a psychiatric opinion?\n\n**Patient:**\nI really don't remember what happened.\nI was on my bicycle and a car ran into me and I don't remember what happened next.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat did they tell you afterwards?\n\n**Patient:**\nThat I flew my bike right into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're... You're laughing at that.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat that sounds like, flying straight into the street.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you find that funny, yeah?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause it reminds me of something about two years ago.\nA... A friend of mine, he took me out on this motorbike and he stopped to get something at a convenience store.\nAnyway, I was really bored so I pretended that I knew how to drive it.\nYou put your hands on the handlebars and go like this.\nWell, it was one of those monster bikes.\nJust by turning the handle a little, it just flies.\nSo, suddenly, I'm like, zoom, and it takes off.\nMy head, it whips back like this and when I look down, I realise I'm riding into the street.\nTotally crashed into a car.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nThere was this old woman standing nearby and she saw all this. \"I saw her. She did it on purpose.\n\"She tried to kill herself. She tried to kill herself.\" That's what she was yelling?\nYeah, she was like a crazy woman.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\nCourse, it couldn't have been that funny when it happened, I'm sure?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Not really.\nI wanted to kill her. I was just lying there.\nI couldn't move. I couldn't do anything.\nI wanted to yell, \"Shut up, you... you idiot.\n\"Why are you screaming?\" You know? But I couldn't speak.\nIt's like this feeling...\nwhen somebody says something about you and you can't defend yourself.\nIt's totally unfair.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLike that social worker you were talking about.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat does she have to do with it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, didn't you feel that she was speaking for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, but I could have said something.\nI just didn't want to.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHm.\nSo, tell me a little more about this, uh, this accident.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's all in that report.\n\nWhere did it happen?\n\n**Patient:**\nIn a gas station on Madison near the gym where I train.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you were on the way to the gym?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. I told you I don't remember anything.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you feel comfortable talking about yourself, Sophie?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nMy name is Sophie. I'm 16 years old.\nI've been a gymnast since the age of six and a half.\nI was US junior champion at the age of 12.\nI'm an only child.\nI don't know. What do you wanna know?\nIn another few months are the national trials.\nLast chance to qualify for the Olympics.\nI'm kind of like... an Olympic hopeful.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWow.\nThat's really impressive.

A friend of mine, he took me out on this motorbike and he stopped to get something at a convenience store.\nAnyway, I was really bored so I pretended that I knew how to drive it.\nYou put your hands on the handlebars and go like this.\nWell, it was one of those monster bikes.\nJust by turning the handle a little, it just flies.\nSo, suddenly, I'm like, zoom, and it takes off.\nMy head, it whips back like this and when I look down, I realise I'm riding into the street.\nTotally crashed into a car.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nThere was this old woman standing nearby and she saw all this. \"I saw her. She did it on purpose.\n\"She tried to kill herself. She tried to kill herself.\" That's what she was yelling?\nYeah, she was like a crazy woman.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\nCourse, it couldn't have been that funny when it happened, I'm sure?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo. Not really.\nI wanted to kill her. I was just lying there.\nI couldn't move. I couldn't do anything.\nI wanted to yell, \"Shut up, you... you idiot.\n\"Why are you screaming?\" You know? But I couldn't speak.\nIt's like this feeling...\nwhen somebody says something about you and you can't defend yourself.\nIt's totally unfair.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nLike that social worker you were talking about.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat does she have to do with it?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, didn't you feel that she was speaking for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah, but I could have said something.\nI just didn't want to.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHm.\nSo, tell me a little more about this, uh, this accident.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's all in that report.\n\nWhere did it happen?\n\n**Patient:**\nIn a gas station on Madison near the gym where I train.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you were on the way to the gym?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. I told you I don't remember anything.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you feel comfortable talking about yourself, Sophie?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nMy name is Sophie. I'm 16 years old.\nI've been a gymnast since the age of six and a half.\nI was US junior champion at the age of 12.\nI'm an only child.\nI don't know. What do you wanna know?\nIn another few months are the national trials.\nLast chance to qualify for the Olympics.\nI'm kind of like... an Olympic hopeful.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWow.\nThat's really impressive. Congratulations.\n\n**Patient:**\nThank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo how is life in general?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, apart from the gymnastics.\nHow's life?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's great.\nI just don't have the energy for This Is Your Life right now.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThis Is Your Life? What do... What do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nYou know, like the TV show.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou're way too young to know about that show.\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's on DVD. My mom's friend watches it all the time.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you think of it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt's OK.\nSome of the people on it are so old.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\n Why do you think they put old people on that?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Cos they have nothing better to do?\nThey're retired and dying off fast so they put them on the show before it's too late.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOh.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo do you think you can help me with this professional opinion or not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIt's not that simple, Sophie.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy not?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause it's not like an X-ray where you can take photographs, look at the results and then you go on your way.\nIt doesn't quite work like that.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nOK, so I guess I'll leave.\nWould you at least like to read what it says in the report?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIf you want me to.\n\n**Patient:**\nLike you already know what it says?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. I've no idea what it says.\n\n**Patient:**\nListen, I didn't come here to talk about myself.\nI just need your opinion.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo you want me to give you my opinion based on what I read and the conversation that we've had today, is that it?\n\n**Patient:**\nIs that a problem?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo. No.\nI'll write up an opinion and, um...\nwhen you come next week, you can decide whether you want to use it or not.\n\n**Patient:**\nJust like that, without any more questions?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, what kind of questions do you want me to ask?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. Shrink-like questions.\nSay, about Mom, Dad, that kind of thing?\nDoesn't sound like you're interested.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhy would you say that, Sophie?\nI am very interested in everything that you have to say.\nI mean that.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou spoke to my mother already, didn't you?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI didn't.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou already know what it says in there.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI've never spoken to her.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou did and you're letting me sit here and you know exactly what's in that envelope.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWas I... Was I supposed to talk to her?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat, did you, like, plan everything?\nLike I'm some kind of idiot, you planned some charade?\nWhat's the point? Whatever. She would send me to someone like you.\nI should have listened to my father. He called them a cult of crazies.\nOpen the door for me, please.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAnd if I did speak to your mom?\n\n**Patient:**\nI knew it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, then?\n\n**Patient:**\nIt means you're a liar, OK?\nCos I know how it's supposed to work.\nYou're supposed to read that report and ask the stupid shrink questions you ask.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDoesn't it seems unprofessional to so not do it that way?\nMaybe I have something to say about what it says in there.\nI just wanted to read the report by myself before our meeting next week. That's all.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhat meeting next week?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'd like us to meet three or four times for me to form an opinion of you, to get to know you a little.\nDon't you think?\nOtherwise... it wouldn't be professional.\nHm?\nI'll read it now.\nOK?\nSo are all these ships instead of sailing for real?\n\n**Patient:**\nUh-huh.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAt least you won't get seasick.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh...\nI don't know about that.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you mean?\n\n**Patient:**\nSometimes I can get quite wobbly just sitting right here.\nYou have to make a round window to the outside.\nThen you'll feel like you're in a real ship.\nDid you really read all those books or is it just to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nUh-huh.\n\n**Patient:**\nYes, you read them or yes, you're trying to make an impression?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYes.\nI've read them.\nI feel sorry for the books up there.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh. Why do you feel sorry for them?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhere would you put them?\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't know. They're your fucking books.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou suffer from asthma.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. How do you know that?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThere's an inhaler here.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh, thanks. I've been looking everywhere for that. Thank you.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSo what, you could have died without it?\nAccording to what it says here...\nit looks like you could have died too.\n\n**Patient:**\nYeah. That would have solved a lot of problems.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat would it solve?\n\n**Patient:**\nNothing. I didn't mean anything by it.\nCan I talk to you like a normal person?\nDo you drive your daughter crazy with questions like this too?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nMuch more crazy, believe me.\nHow d'you know I had a daughter?\n\n**Patient:**\nBecause you do.\nYou know my mother.\nYou were on the PTA committee at Arlington elementary.\nI was there before I went off to a private school.\nI was in the same year as your daughter.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWell, why didn't you tell me that before?\n\n**Patient:**\nHm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou said that the, uh... that the social worker spoke to you like she knew you.\n\n**Patient:**\nShe was such a retard.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDid she ask you if, um... if you think about death a lot?\n\n**Patient:**\nHow did you know that?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nAccording to what it says here, she was trying to prove that the accident was your fault.\nIt's a good thing you didn't answer any of her questions.\nBy the way, everybody thinks about death.\nI bet she didn't say that, though.\nDid she ask you if you had any specific thoughts about death?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you?\n\n**Patient:**\nDo I what?\nEveryone... Everyone thinks about death and, uh...\nimagines how it will come to them.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDo you have any more specific thoughts about it?\nI mean, maybe you have certain thoughts that you'd like to talk about.\n\n**Patient:**\nUnless you're worried about what I...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI'm not worried.\n\n**Patient:**\nOK.\nIs this how it's going to be for three appointments?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs this a little difficult for you?\n\n**Patient:**\nNo.\nCan I have some water?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nSure.\n\n**Patient:**\nOh.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nHang on a minute.\nSorry about this. It's for my little patients, the elves.\nIt's a bendy one.\nYou need help with that?\nMust be really hard to be, uh... be handicapped like that.\nWhat's the hardest thing about it?\n\n**Patient:**\nEveryone treats me like a baby.\nHm.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nDid you come here by yourself today?\n\n**Patient:**\nYes. By bus.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYour mom didn't offer to drive you?\nYeah, right. She knew there was no chance I'd say yes.\nBefore, when you got angry, when, uh...\nwhen you thought that she'd called me, I asked myself, \"Why didn't she call?\" It makes sense that she would call me first.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nI don't... What do you mean?\nI'm trying to figure out why you got so angry when you thought...\n\n**Patient:**\nI don't get it. She did call?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, no.\n\n**Patient:**\nDid she call or not? Tell me already.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nNo, she didn't call.\n\n**Patient:**\nSo why are we back to this again?\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBecause I got the feeling that when you got angry, you wanted your mother to call, just so that \nyou could get angry with her.\n\n**Patient:**\nYou have no idea what I'm looking for.\nYou just don't get it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nOK.\nSo...\nwhy don't you explain it to me, then?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe thinks that what's written there is true.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat's true?\n\n**Patient:**\nWhatever it says. \"Suicidal tendencies\", blah, blah, blah.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nThat's what your mother says is true?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe thinks that this accident is an opportunity to get rid of the sports thing.\nThat's what she calls it.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nBut what does that have to do with this report?\n\n**Patient:**\nShe's afraid.\nShe doesn't believe that...\nShe thinks that, because of all this competition and perfectionism, she thinks that I wanted to kill myself. And that's bullshit.\nIt's been like this for years.\nI've been under pressure for years and she has never supported me.\nAll the other mothers are right there, all over us, visiting the gym, the training camps, all of it.\nAnd the only thing she has to say is, \"What do you need this for?\" It's obvious she doesn't understand anything.\nAll this pressure, it doesn't make any difference.\nIt's so silly. Why would I hurt myself now, just before the nationals when I have all the...\nAnd if I fail the lawsuit, I really have no chance.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat do you mean, fail? Do you see this as a kind of test?\nTell me, why do you...\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy are you making it sound like it's...\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nWhat?\n\n**Patient:**\nI didn't come here for therapy.\nI just need you to write your opinion and tell me that I'm perfectly all right and tell them that I'm not some crazy who flies into cars every day.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nIs that why you came here today, Sophie?\nFor me to tell you that you're all right, that you're not crazy?\nIs that the test you're afraid of failing?\n\n**Patient:**\nI have to go.\nIt's ten to already.\n\n**Dr. Stanley:\nYou probably have to turn on your cellphone now.\n\n**Patient:**\nWhy? Are you worried that I won't be available?\n--- End of transcript ---\n\nThe patient is looking happy. You are feeling neutral.\nNow, you will make the patient feel at ease. Continue your dialogue and tell them how much you look forward to this session.\nTwo sentences maximum. Speak CLEARLY and CONCISELY.
