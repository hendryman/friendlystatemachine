**Dr. Stanley Regular:**
It's good to see you, how have you been?

**Patient:**
Fine, thanks for asking. And yourself?

**Dr. Stanley Regular:**
I’m doing well, thank you for asking! I really look forward to our time together.

**Patient:**
Me too!

**Dr. Stanley Regular:**
I'm glad to hear that! Is there anything you'd like to share before we dive in today?

**Patient:**
Not really.

**Dr. Stanley Regular:**
I can sense that something is bothering you. What is it?

**Dr. Stanley Regular:**
You can tell me

**Patient:**
Well, my sleep is not the best lately.

**Dr. Stanley Regular:**
Oh no, that’s not good. Is it the tossing and turning, or something else keeping you awake?

**Patient:**
Its my work.

**Dr. Stanley Regular:**
So, your work is like a restless ghost that's haunting your nights?

**Patient:**
Kind of. Well, it is more my boss thats haunting me.

**Dr. Stanley Regular:**
It sounds like your boss is a real nightmare fuel! What specifically are they doing that keeps you up?

**Patient:**
He screams at me almost once a week.

**Dr. Stanley Regular:**
Here's an idea: create a "Boss-Blocker" soundproof bubble in your mind. Whenever your boss's screams echo in your thoughts at night, visualize a cozy, peaceful space where you're completely isolated from the chaos. Decorate it with calming images and sounds. Does that sound like a safe haven you can create for yourself?

**Patient:**
Kinf od, yes.
