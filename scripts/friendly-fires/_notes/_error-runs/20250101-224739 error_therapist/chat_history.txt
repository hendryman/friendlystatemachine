------s_start------
Dr. Stanley Regular: It's good to see you, how have you been?
Patient: Fine, thanks for asking. And yourself?
------s_smalltalk------
Dr. Stanley Regular: I’m doing well, thank you for asking! I really look forward to our time together.
Patient: Me too!
Dr. Stanley Regular: I'm glad to hear that! Is there anything you'd like to share before we dive in today?
Patient: Not really.
------s_issues_explore------
Dr. Stanley Regular: I can sense that something is bothering you. What is it?
Dr. Stanley Regular: You can tell me
Patient: Well, my sleep is not the best lately.
Dr. Stanley Regular: Oh no, that’s not good. Is it the tossing and turning, or something else keeping you awake?
Patient: Its my work.
Dr. Stanley Regular: So, your work is like a restless ghost that's haunting your nights?
Patient: Kind of. Well, it is more my boss thats haunting me.
Dr. Stanley Regular: It sounds like your boss is a real nightmare fuel! What specifically are they doing that keeps you up?
Patient: He screams at me almost once a week.
------s_issues_resolve------
Dr. Stanley Regular: Here's an idea: create a "Boss-Blocker" soundproof bubble in your mind. Whenever your boss's screams echo in your thoughts at night, visualize a cozy, peaceful space where you're completely isolated from the chaos. Decorate it with calming images and sounds. Does that sound like a safe haven you can create for yourself?
Patient: Kinf od, yes.
------s_issues_compliment------
Dr. Stanley Regular: I'm glad you're open to the idea! Do you feel a bit better thinking about that safe haven?
Patient: No really.
------s_diary------
Dr. Stanley Regular: Wonderful! Did you bring your diary with you?
Patient: No. I dont have a diary.
Dr. Stanley Regular: We discussed this last time. Your dream diary! Don't you remember?
Patient: No. I have never been here?
Dr. Stanley Regular: Then tell me about a recent dream you had.
Patient: I was having sex with a goat inside a spaceship.
------s_dream_was_told------
Dr. Stanley Regular: Interesting. How did that make you feel?
Patient: Guilty.
Dr. Stanley Regular: And what do you think that dream meant?
Patient: I have no idea.
Dr. Stanley Regular: You're lost in space with a goat? Maybe you should try navigating your own damn life first!
Patient: What?
