**Patient:**
I’ve been feeling really stressed out at work. 
**Therapist:**
Interesting. A mountain of paperwork threatening to bury you alive?
**Patient:**
Kind of, yes.
**Therapist:**
Tell me more.
**Patient:**
My boss is under a lot of pressure, and they put that pressure on to me.
**Therapist:**
So you feel a bit like a tightly wound rubber band about to snap? 
**Patient:**
Sometimes, yes.
**Therapist:**
Well, in that case, my prescription is this: acquire a small, preferably fluffy, stuffed animal. This will be your 'Stress Sponge.' Every time you feel that tension rising, give that little critter a good squeeze. Imagine all that stress being absorbed into its fluffy innards. Bonus points if you give it a ridiculous name like 'Sir Reginald Fluffington the Third, Esquire.' Does that sound appealing to you?
**Patient:**
Maybe, yes

**Patient:**
I'm having trouble sleeping.
**Therapist:**
Oh. That is not good. Is it the noisy neighbors? Or the racing thoughts in your head?
**Patient:**
I don't know.
**Therapist:**
Tell me more.
**Patient:**
I wake up in the middle of the night, and then I cant get to sleep again.
**Therapist:**
What's the most unusual thing you've ever tried to help you sleep?
**Patient:**
Masturbating on the toilet.
**Therapist:**
Here's what you do: set up a mini disco ball in your bedroom. When you can't sleep, turn it on and have a silent disco party for one. Dance until you drop. Or until you're too exhausted to stay awake.  Does that sound appealing to you?
**Patient:**
I'm not sure

**Patient:**
I'm terrified of public speaking. 
**Therapist:**
Oh my. I can cretainly relate to that. How do you feel when that fear is hitting you?
**Patient:**
My palms get sweaty, my voice shakes.
**Therapist:**
Tell me more.
**Patient:**
I get totally paralised. And just talk garbage.
**Therapist:**
Do you feel like a human fire hydrant about to burst?
**Patient:**
I'm not sure…
**Therapist:**
Next time you speak in public, imagine you're a wizard casting a spell on your audience. Each word you speak is a magical incantation turning your listeners into frogs or turning their fear into butterflies. Practice your speech in front of a mirror, wand in hand, and cast away. Does that sound like a spellbinding solution?
**Patient:**
Probably, yes.

**Patient:**
I keep putting things off until the last minute.
**Therapist:**
Ah, the siren call of the snack aisle! How does this temptation manifest?
**Patient:**
It's like there's a gremlin inside me that takes over whenever I see a bag of chips.
**Therapist:**
Tell me more about this gremlin.
**Patient:**
It whispers sweet nothings about the crunch and saltiness, and I'm powerless.
**Therapist:**
So, you're at war with your inner snack demon?
**Patient:**
Yeah, and I'm losing.
**Therapist:**
Here's your battle plan: imagine every piece of junk food as a tiny, angry gremlin. Each time you reach for a snack, visualize yourself as a culinary warrior, armed with a giant fork. Skewer those gremlins and banish them to the fiery depths of your stomach, where they can't harm you or your diet. Does this sound like a fight you can win?
**Patient:**
I think so, yes.

**Patient:**
I'm dealing with a lot of anger issues lately.
**Therapist:**
Anger, the hot sauce of emotions. How do you feel when you're angry?
**Patient:**
It's like a volcano inside me, ready to erupt at any moment.
**Therapist:**
Tell me more about this volcano.
**Patient:**
It's unpredictable, and when it goes off, it's like everything around me burns.
**Therapist:**
So, your inner volcano is looking for an outlet?
**Patient:**
Yes, exactly.
**Therapist:**
Here's what you do: Build a mental doomsday device. Every time you feel the anger building, activate this device in your mind. It sends all your anger into a black hole, where it's compressed into a tiny, harmless marble. Keep a jar of these marbles as a trophy of your conquests over anger. Does this sound like a way to contain your eruptions?
**Patient:**
It's... an interesting approach.

**Patient:**
I have this overwhelming fear of the dark.
**Therapist:**
Ah, the darkness, a canvas for all our fears. What do you see when the lights go out?
**Patient:**
Monsters, shadows moving, things that aren't really there.
**Therapist:**
Tell me more about these monsters.
**Patient:**
They're terrifying, like something out of a horror movie.
**Therapist:**
So, it's like you're living in a perpetual horror film set?
**Patient:**
Not really. No
**Therapist:**
Here's your script for survival: Become the director of your own horror movie. Each time you turn off the light, you're on set. Arm yourself with a flashlight, which you'll use as your director's camera. Command the monsters to perform, make them dance to your tune, or even better, cast them as the comedic relief in your dark comedy. Does this sound like a plot twist you can handle?
**Patient:**
I might give it a try.

**Patient:**
I keep pushing off important tasks.
**Therapist:**
Ah, the procrastination parade! Which task are you currently avoiding?
**Patient:**
A big report for work that’s due next week.
**Therapist:**
Tell me more about this report.
**Patient:**
It's just overwhelming, and I end up doing everything else but work on it.
**Therapist:**
So, you're like a superhero of distraction, saving the world from your own productivity?
**Patient:**
Pretty much.
**Therapist:**
Here's what you do: Set up a 'Procrastination Altar.' Every time you're about to procrastinate, you must first bow to your altar and offer a token – could be a candy, a note, or a small toy. Once your altar is full, it's time to unleash your inner productivity dragon. Does this sound like a ritual you can commit to?
**Patient:**
That's... quite the ceremony, but I'll give it a go.
