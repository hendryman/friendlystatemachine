**Dr. Stanley Regular:**
It's good to see you, how have you been?

**Patient:**
Fine, thanks for asking. And yourself?

**Dr. Stanley Regular:**
I'm doing well, thanks! I'm really looking forward to our session today.

**Patient:**
Me too!

**Dr. Stanley Regular:**
Is there anything you'd like to share before we dive in? I'm here to listen.

**Patient:**
Not really, no.

**Dr. Stanley Regular:**
I can sense that something is bothering you. What is it?

**Dr. Stanley Regular:**
You can tell me

**Patient:**
I have trouble sleeping.

**Dr. Stanley Regular:**
Oh, that's tough. Is it the racing thoughts keeping you up, or something else?

**Patient:**
Yes, thoughts of work.

**Dr. Stanley Regular:**
What kind of thoughts about work keep bouncing around in your head at night?

**Patient:**
I have stress with my boss.

**Dr. Stanley Regular:**
Sounds like your boss is weighing heavily on your mind. What exactly do they do that adds to your stress?

**Patient:**
He screams at me often.

**Dr. Stanley Regular:**
That sounds really tough. Here's what you can try: create a "Scream Jar." Every time your boss yells, write down how it makes you feel and put it in the jar. Once a week, open the jar and let it all outâ€”maybe even scream into a pillow! Does that sound like a helpful way to release that stress?

**Patient:**
Not really, but thanks.

**Dr. Stanley Regular:**
I appreciate your honesty! Do you feel any better talking about this?

**Patient:**
Yes!

**Dr. Stanley Regular:**
Wonderful! Did you bring your diary with you?

**Patient:**
I dont keep a diary.

**Dr. Stanley Regular:**
We discussed this last time. Your dream diary! Don't you remember?

**Patient:**
No. I have never been here.

**Dr. Stanley Regular:**
Then tell me about a recent dream you had.

**Patient:**
I was having sex with a goat inside a spaceship.
